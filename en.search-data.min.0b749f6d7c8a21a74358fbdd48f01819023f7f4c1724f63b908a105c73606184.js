In this chapter on Conducting, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about tracking and checking the ringing, using information that you can get from the composition itself and doing some study beforehand.\nThis first section is on checking the ringing, and it focuses on how to use memorization and other skills you already have to check the ringing, without the use of coursing orders.1\nWhen learning to check the ringing, it\u0026rsquo;s often useful to start by studying the composition a little. The key is learning your landmarks and finding places where you know you can check that your ringing is accurate so far. I will focus on a few different landmarks that you can use to check the ringing as it\u0026rsquo;s going. I\u0026rsquo;ll use an example example of a quarter peal of Plain Bob Major.\nLandmarks #  Landmark: Fixed bells #    The composition is laid out with each course displayed as a line. At the end of each course, the 6 is at the “end” of the line and the 7 and 8 are nowhere to be seen. This is by convention; since the 7 and 8 are unaffected, they are not written out in this style. So you can imagine a little “78” tacked on to the end of each of those rows. You’ll note the treble is also omitted, for similar shorthand reasons. In this composition, then, you can see that the 6, 7, and 8 remain end up at the same place at the end of every course.2 So, at the end of every course, you can check those three bells and make sure they are in the right place. Every other course, the 5 is also back in its usual position.\nLandmark: Parts #  Another useful feature of a composition to watch for is the \u0026ldquo;part end\u0026rdquo;, which is the last row written above.3 That row will come up after the end of the first part. Here, it’s 42356 (again, imagine the invisible 78 at the end) which signifies that the 5678 are in their home positions, and the 2, 3, and 4 are swapped about at the beginning. I won’t get into details about how to derive later part heads, but I’ll just tell you that after the second part you’ll get 34256 and after you’ve rung three parts you’ll come back to 23456 (rounds!). Memorizing the order that the bells should be in at the end of the part means you have a couple of landmarks partway through the composition where you can always check to make sure the ringing is accurate, even if you can’t yet manage to track it all the time.\nLandmark: Plain course #  If you didn’t ring (nearly) an entire plain course at the beginning of a composition, the remaining bits of the plain course often come up in the middle or at the end of a composition. Often, your ear will tell you when you’re in the plain course. Maybe the other ringers will smile at each other, wondering if this is going to be the end! You can also use these leads as landmarks. For example, in the quarter peal composition above, you enter the plain course again after the second “single” at Wrong. Then, just when it seems about to come round, it’s time for a “bob”!.\nOther landmarks #  In a quarter peal or peal of minor, watch for it to come round (at least twice!). Watch for “roll-ups,” especially on high numbers. Know who’s making the bob, or involved in the single. Maybe knowing what happens at every call is too much, but you can still learn a few key ones, like at the end of a part.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re particularly good at memorizing, you can also memorize any other aspect of the composition that is useful to you, like the course heads for example.\nEventually you can build up to using coursing order landmarks, and from there up to using the coursing order the entire time during ringing \u0026mdash; but there’s no reason you can’t use these other strategies, too!\nChecking it live #  Of course, there is a limit to how far studying can get you. Sometimes things can go wrong that you can\u0026rsquo;t anticipate or necessarily easily prepare for in advance. However, there are a couple of different techniques you can use for checking on the ringing as it\u0026rsquo;s going.\nGive structural hints #  For bands that know the method well, giving structural hints can be a great help when something has gone wibbly. For example, stating when the lead end is or the half lead is can often give stability to a method that has been a little shaky.\nCertain methods also have bits where it is easy to go wrong, and often conductors will mention them if the ringing has been unsteady. For example, in Kent Treble Bob sometimes people will forget whether to dodge or hunt; simply stating whether the handstroke/backstroke pair is a dodge or a hunt will often fix the problem. Or the ringers may forget about the Kent 3-4 places, in which case a quick \u0026ldquo;Places!\u0026rdquo; will fix it. In Stedman it is common to forget to finish one\u0026rsquo;s last whole turn. In London Surprise Major, mentioning where the fishtails in the back go (treble\u0026rsquo;s dodge in 3-4) can be very useful. And so and and so on \u0026mdash; if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the common places for trips in a method you are conducting, see if you can ask someone about it in advance.\nWatch the social cues #  Body language and social cues can be a valuable tool for conducting. While these days it is no longer a given that you are able to see the faces of your fellow ringers, when you are fortunate enough to be ringing as well as seeing the faces of those you are ringing with, they can be a great aid to your conducting. Sometimes it is possible to tell which ringer is lost by the position of their shoulders, or by the look on their face! Then, if you can see a \u0026ldquo;hole\u0026rdquo; in the ringing using your rope sight, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to set them into the right place.\nFor some conductors the process of giving structural hints and watching social cues is very instinctual. I admit it was instinctual for me, and I find it hard to describe this process and teach it in a useful way. However, I found it revelatory when Simon Gay wrote a series of articles on his blog about this type of non-coursing-order-dependent conducting, and I highly recommend you read them if you are interested in learning more. The two in particular I am thinking of are his article on structural conducting and his article on local conducting.\nWhether you read those articles or not, I think one of the biggest determiners of whether these strategies are available to you have to do with how much ropesight you have. Building ropesight is so different for everyone; some people develop it nearly instantly and others struggle.4\nBut there are a few exercises you can try for building ropesight. First, watch as much ringing as you can. If you\u0026rsquo;re sitting out, watch the ringing. It\u0026rsquo;s a method you\u0026rsquo;ve watched a million times before? Try to pick out the coursing orders. It\u0026rsquo;s a method you\u0026rsquo;ve never even heard of, let alone knowing the line? See if you can quickly ask someone what the line of the treble is, and see if you can follow it up and down the changes. Or, see if you can tell which bell is ringing first or ringing last. These types of ropesight exercises can be practised at any level and will greatly aid your ability to see and react to what\u0026rsquo;s happening around you in the tower. Other people will have written much more on ropesight than I have time for here!\nSummary #  These are a collection of strategies and tools you can use as a conductor. You may use all, or some, or none; but practicing using different techniques will make you a more flexible conductor, which I think is valuable in its own right (even if you decide not to use them often or at all in the end).\nExercises #  Write this #  Write down, in a journal, diary, blog post, or other venue (private or public), the types of tools you use when you are conducting. Are there any tools or ideas you\u0026rsquo;d like to add to this list? Think about how you can best get practice using these new tools.\nTalk about this #  Ask around your local tower, your Facebook group, or other venues about how other people think about conducting. You\u0026rsquo;ll likely find that everyone has their own ways of doing things! By learning about a broad range of strategies, you are more likely to find one or more that work well for you.\nRead this #  Read Simon Gay\u0026rsquo;s two blog articles on structural conducting and on local conducting.\nNotes #    If the advice seems familiar, it might be because much of it is derived from an article I wrote for The Ringing World in 2020. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Bells that remain in the same position at the end of a course or part are often called fixed bells. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Recall that the \u0026ldquo;technically correct\u0026rdquo; term is the part head, but this term is mostly used in composing contexts; the vast majority of the time, the common usage \u0026ldquo;part end\u0026rdquo; is what you will hear about in practice. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I remember one time at my local tower when a ringer\u0026rsquo;s uncle came by to visit. He had never rung before, and didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about change ringing other than his niece\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm. I sat next to him during a course of Plain Bob Minor and was talking him through what the treble was doing. He paused for a minute, and then asked me why the 5 was ringing after the 6 like that. Immediately after he asked me the question, a lead end happened (the 5 made 2nds) and he exclaimed \u0026ldquo;Now it\u0026rsquo;s changed!\u0026rdquo; and then described the new relationship between the 5 and the treble. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know the ringing terminology, but he had incredible ropesight and an instinctive ability to pick out coursing orders, which to this day I find incredible. I suspect his level of innate skill at picking out coursing orders is very unusual! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/supplemental_skills/1_choosing_your_touch/','title':"Choosing Your Touch",'section':"Supplemental Skills",'content':"Choosing Your Touch #  Regardless of whether you are newly learning to call and conduct or whether you\u0026rsquo;ve already called 1000 peals of Surprise Royal, there will be times when you need to pick a touch for a practice night, or pick a quarter peal or peal composition. If you\u0026rsquo;re very experienced, you\u0026rsquo;ve likely already got a \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; for which compositions you prefer in style, but if you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out, it\u0026rsquo;s not unusual to feel a bit adrift in the huge variety of compositions available. Composition Library alone has over 43,000 compositions at the time of writing, and other collections of compositions may similarly number in the thousands (though they are less easy for this writer to quantify).\nThe choice of touch is often one of the first choices made, and it is often made in concert with a choice of band and band placement. But to simplify, let\u0026rsquo;s assume here that you have a set band; say, your Wednesday night practice group or Sunday service band or Saturday morning quarter peal attempt band. What sorts of things might you consider when picking a touch? That\u0026rsquo;s what this section will discuss.\nPicking a practice night touch #  There are several things that must be balanced here. First, you have to pick an appropriate method or stage. Sometimes, the Tower Captain will ask you to prepare a touch of a specific method and stage, in which case the choice is out of your hands. Or, perhaps your band nearly always rings Plain Bob Doubles; in which case it is simple to pick a method and stage. If you have a choice of method or stage however, here are some things to consider:\n Is there a method your tower is working on? Do you feel ready to ring the method (including from the treble) while conducting to give the rest of your band that practice? Is there someone in the band who is working on something? For example, maybe you have a band member working their way up to touches of Plain Bob Major, or bob courses of Cambridge Surprise Minor. Do you have enough people to ring at a given stage? You may have 8 people in your band, but if 3 of them are learners, it might be best to stick to Minor to give the learners the best shot at ringing with a steady band. Or not! Everyone has their own style here. Do you have 8 people who all want to ring, but not all of whom are ready for a touch of any method? In this case, consider whether the best choice is in fact not to call a touch at all, but to ring a plain course instead.  When you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen a method and stage, you can also choose a touch. Consider how long it should be; often a full plain course of Surprise Major is deemed too long for a practice night, so something under 224 changes might be more preferred; then again, if you have exactly 8 Surprise Major ringers, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not! Consider whether you want any particular member to be unaffected. You might need to place them in a particular spot in the circle for that to be the case, or you may want to watch their bell as you conduct. If you are placing ringers on bells, consider also whether some people might prefer a heavier or a lighter bells; do they want to learn how to ring a heavy bell for the first time? Or learn to ring a light and flighty bell? Consider if this is the \u0026ldquo;right touch\u0026rdquo; for that learning time. If you are not placing ringers on bells, think about how the social dynamics might influence who takes hold and where in the circle, and how that will affect the type of touch that might be appropriate.\nBalancing the needs of a band on practice night is tricky business. Each band, tower captain, and individual ringer has different needs and wants. Some prioritize good striking over trying something new; some prioritize having a learner in every band over having more complex touches during practice night. Thinking carefully about what your priorities are and how to use your position in the band as a caller or conductor to mesh with the priorities of your band and fellow ringers will serve you all well.\nPicking a Sunday service touch #  Sunday service ringing often gives rise to a new set of priorities. Regardless of practice night habits (or the religiosity of the ringers), often bands want to showcase their best ringing for service as part of a show of their respect for the service and the Church. So, choosing a touch for Sunday service can feel quite different. You might ask yourself:\n What methods (and what stages) do we, as a band, ring to our best advantage? How can we include those ringers that have made the effort to come to Sunday service, while also assuring the quality of the ringing? Should we ring a touch or a plain course or half course or call changes or something else entirely? It may be that a touch is not the most appropriate choice for your band on a particular Sunday. What is the right length? Do we have exactly enough ringers to ring something fairly long, or do I need a variety of short pieces to cycle a large number of ringers in and out?  Other than the special emphasis on high-quality ringing, the considerations are often similar to those about a practice night touch. However, there is often an extra-special consideration given to the very last touch rung before the start of a service (before the lower, if your band lower your bells after service ringing). This touch will have the widest audience, and it is nice for the parishioners and ringers alike if they can be welcomed to their Sunday service by the best ringing the ringers have to offer! As such, it can be wise to think of what you could do, and then take it back a step simpler to something you can do extremely well. Eleanor Linford contributes that she always thinks of a quote from Coco Chanel when considering choosing a Sunday service touch: \u0026ldquo;Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off.\u0026rdquo; Before you pull off, look in the mirror and choose something a little simpler!\nPicking a quarter peal or peal composition #  Picking a quarter peal or peal composition often feels fairly different. I personally often spend more time picking out quarter peal or peal compositions than I do random practice night touches, in part because they are longer and I want to be assured of my ability to conduct them well. The band is often taking special time out of their schedule for the attempt and it\u0026rsquo;s nicest when the conductor has put in the work ahead of time to give the attempt its best chance of success.1\nIn this section, to keep it simple we\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you have a band of ringers of equal ability, so anyone can ring anywhere in your quarter peal or peal. (If this is not the case, read on to the next section about placing your band, which will discuss some ideas about band placement).\nYou may or may not already have picked a method and stage, even though you likely know the number of ringers you\u0026rsquo;re working with. Here are some things to think about when you\u0026rsquo;re deciding:\n Should we choose a \u0026ldquo;stretch\u0026rdquo; method to try something new, or a comfortable and familiar method? What can I trust myself to conduct well? Should I choose a composition I already know, or a new one? Should I choose a multi-part composition, or a single-part composition? A single-part is often more memorization. If choosing a multi-part, what type of part end do I want? Do I want the challenge of a cyclic part end, the comfort of a handbell-friendly part end, or something else entirely? How many calling positions am I comfortable with using? Do I want a composition on the shorter side (1250 for a quarter peal) or am I ok with it being on the longer side (1500 for a quarter peal). Do I want a date touch? How important is this to \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo;? Should I choose something dead simple I have a very good chance of getting, or stretch myself and my band a bit?  In the end, picking something you are confident that you can conduct well and that your ringers can ring well is likely to lead to the highest probability of success. That said, not all ringing is about \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo;! Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s about stretching yourself, making progress, and challenging your band, all of which can be equally enjoyable. Only you know yourself and your band well enough to make these kinds of choices.\nNotes #    However, 100% chance of success is never a guarantee, nor necessarily should it be! Simon Linford shares that he often likes to choose compositions which he has a 95% chance of calling. Everyone messes up sometimes, and it\u0026rsquo;s alright to go in with that perspective. Study what you can and aim to do well, and then what happens will happen. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/conducting/2_coursing_orders/','title':"Coursing Orders",'section':"Conducting",'content':"Coursing Orders #  Coursing orders are a fundamental tool of the conductor, and many if not most conductors use them for checking the ringing. But what is a coursing order? This section is here to answer that question. For this section and the next, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on coursing orders in the context of Plain Bob.\nBack to Basics: Plain Hunt #  Let\u0026rsquo;s take a good look at plain hunting.\n Here, the red line is the treble, and all the other bells are shown by both their number (like \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;) and by a particular color. I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved looking at the grid for plain hunt, because it has such pleasing symmetry; but it contains other interesting facts as well.\nLook at the order in which the bells come to lead. After rounds, the 2 leads, then the 4, the 6, the 8. Then the odd bells: 7, 5, 3. Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s time for the treble\u0026rsquo;s lead again.\nLook at the order in which the treble passes all the bells. First the treble rings over the 2, and then the 4, the 6, and then 8. Then the odd bells: 7, 5, 3. Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s the half lead and the treble turns around at the back. Who should the treble meet but the 2 again? Then it rings over the 4, 6, 8, 7, 5, 3 again before it gets to lead.\nThe orders are the same, and this ordering of the bells all passing by each other, rotating within the method, is known as a coursing order. This order is perturbed by calls but remains steady within a method otherwise. Because this order is preserved when there are no calls (and it changes when there are calls), it will be useful for the conductor, who is concerned with how the order of the bells changes over the course of a composition.\nWhen writing coursing orders down, we often write them in a condensed format, like this: 2468753. That long string of numbers corresponds to the order in which the bells lead in plain hunt, which (for Plain Hunt) is the same as the order in which the treble passes the bells. Other methods may have different ways of spotting the coursing orders, and different coursing orders entirely.\nHowever, you can write down the coursing order relative to any bell. Try it out a few times here:\nfunction changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } When the 4 is hunting up, what bells does it pass, and in what order? Try writing it out yourself before looking at the possible answers below.\n2468753\n1357268\n6875312\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } When the 3 is hunting down, what bells does it pass, and in what order? Try writing it out yourself before looking at the possible answers below.\n1246875\n4687512\n2468751\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } When the 8 is hunting down, what bells does it pass, and in what order? Try writing it out yourself before looking at the possible answers below.\n2467531\n7531246\n8642135\n \nConventions #  Here are a few things you might have noticed:\n Although I showed plain hunt on 8 bells, there are only 7 bells in each coursing order above. That is because it is conventional to miss out the bell from which you are observing the coursing order. So if you are watching from the 2, you will generally not place the 2 in the coursing order. You can also write out the entire coursing order, not relative to any bell at all. For plain hunt it might look like this: 13578642. Or it might look like this: 86421357. The order is a cycle, which means you can start anywhere and write out the rest of the bells and the order will be the same. Unfortunately, because writing moves along the page in a line, it is terribly limited when it comes to discussing cyclic things \u0026mdash; especially on a computer. It takes a bit more work, but I think a very sensible way to write out coursing orders is like this:   In methods where the treble is doing different work to the other bells (so for example, in Plain Bob where the treble hunts while all the other bells do other things), it is conventionally left out of the coursing order as well. And finally, although it\u0026rsquo;s by no means necessary, it is once again conventional to write out coursing orders relative to the heaviest working bell.   That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of conventions! Not all of them are kept to all of the time, and different people have different preferences. But I just want to inform you about what you are most likely to see.\nCoursing orders in Plain Bob #  So let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at Plain Bob Minor and think about how we might write out the coursing orders, given the above conventions.\nBy convention, we pick the heaviest working bell and write out the coursing order relative to it. Can you spot it?\nfunction changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } What\u0026#39;s the coursing order from the heaviest bell, for the first lead? Include the treble.\n13524\n246531\n53124\n  Great. You might note that I added the caveat \u0026ldquo;for the first lead\u0026rdquo; in the question. This is related to the convention to leave out the treble. Check out the coursing order relative to the 6 in the first lead, and then look at the second lead. Notice anything different?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s right, the 6 crosses the treble at a different point in the second lead. That\u0026rsquo;s because the treble has swapped spots with the 3 at the lead end! The treble will continue to do a do-si-do with various bells at the lead end and will therefore move all through the coursing order. However, because it is doing different work to the rest of the bells, we often don\u0026rsquo;t consider it when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the coursing order. So, in Plain Bob Minor, a common way to write the coursing order would be:\n5324\nThe treble may traipse through at will, but the 6 will always pass the working bells in that order in the plain course. Note that some people will prefer to write the 6 in all the time (giving 53246), but that is not the convention I will follow here in Calling It Round.1\nUsing coursing orders #  When you know what the coursing order ought to be, you can use it to set the ringing straight. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you are in charge and ringing the 6 during a plain course of Plain Bob Minor. You know that the coursing order should be 5324 because just before practice you were scrolling through Calling It Round on your phone. There\u0026rsquo;s a kerfuffle, and suddenly you\u0026rsquo;re passing the bells in this order: 5, 2, 3, 4. You can then shout out that the 3 and the 2 are over and ought to swap places.2\nSimilarly, if you know the coursing order throughout a composition, you can keep a constant check on the ringing by looking at the order in which you pass the bells (bearing in mind that this works well for Plain Bob and many other methods, but there are some methods where watching how you personally pass the bells will not tell you the whole story).\nIf you want to watch the coursing orders not from the heaviest working bell, you have a few different options. Different people will naturally prefer different solutions, but here are a few:\n Figure out what the coursing orders should be from the bell you are ringing. For example from the 2, the plain course has a coursing order of 4653. You can either re-derive or take the coursing order from the 6 (5324) and perform the following operations:      Operation Coursing order     [start] 5324   Add the current observation bell to the back of the line 53246   Move your bell to the front of the line (e.g. the 2) 24653   Remove your bell from the coursing order (e.g. the 2) 4653    This set of operations will allow you to \u0026ldquo;translate\u0026rdquo; any coursing orders from one observation bell to another.\nWatch the heaviest bell ring and note the coursing order second-hand (in my experience, this is tricky!) Figure out how your bell can watch the coursing orders \u0026ldquo;as though\u0026rdquo; they were from the tenor. For example, say I\u0026rsquo;m ringing the 3 but I want to see the 5324 coursing order the way the tenor does. I wait until I see the 5, and then I start keeping track of who I see after the 5. I ring over the 5, then lie behind, then see the treble, the 2, the 4, and the 6. So, except for myself who obviously I can\u0026rsquo;t pass, I see the bells in the order 5(3)246; exactly as desired.  Some of these methods may seem needlessly complex to you, or may seem so much more simple than the others that they are obviously what one should use. But people use a huge variety of these methods and everyone has a different preference!\nPractice #  By now you may be feeling pretty familiar with the concepts above (and if you are not \u0026mdash; that\u0026rsquo;s ok too! I\u0026rsquo;ve listed a bunch of resources below that you can use to learn more.)

In this chapter on Calling, we\u0026rsquo;ll be covering the basics required to call one’s first touch, and to learn simple compositions independently. Calling It Round assumes you have a certain amount of knowledge about change ringing terminology already. “Look to” makes your ears perk up, you might have a favorite “method,” and you might already have rung a “quarter peal” (and if you haven’t already\u0026mdash;you know what it is!).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start off by making sure we\u0026rsquo;re all on the same page in terms of some common terminology, then we\u0026rsquo;ll move through some simple starter touches all the way to quarter peals. Most sections have an interactive component or a set of exercises at the bottom, where you can practice new skills or reflect on new knowledge.\nFirst, let’s learn a bit about where and how to put the bobs in. By the end of this section, you should be able to:\n Explain where, in a lead, the calls should go in; Listen to and “troubleshoot” a video of a caller who might have put some calls in the wrong places  In addition, you will be given some exercises to try out in your tower or with your handbell band. These exercises are designed to help you “find your voice,” so that when it comes time to call a touch you have already gotten some practice talking while ringing.\nWhere to put the calls in #  There are a couple of different things that a caller needs to know how to say (and when to say!). It’s not all just bobs and singles! The caller is responsible for letting the band know when to stop ringing rounds and start ringing the method, and when to stop ringing the method and start ringing rounds. The caller is also responsible for telling the band when to stand after ringing is finished. In this section, I’ll break down the different types of calls and where in the lead the calls are typically made.\nThe diagram on the right shows, visually, where the calls might go in a short touch of Plain Bob Doubles. As with many aspects of ringing, there is no strictly correct place to make the calls, but we’ll cover some of the more common conventions.\n Go, next time! This call tells your band to stop ringing rounds and start ringing the method. Some people will exclusively say “Go, next time!” but others include the method name and would say something like “Go, Plain Bob Doubles!”. Either is fine. Using the latter convention is particularly helpful if there was any confusion about which method or stage was going to be rung before ringing started (e.g., if there was a kerfuffle over whether to ring minor or doubles). Others will choose to include different information such as “Go, next handstroke!” or “Go, Double Norwich at next backstroke!”, especially if there is an unusual start for a date touch or something. You can use your judgement and when in doubt, “Go, [method here]” is a safe bet.\nThe Go call is often made right before (or right as) the treble is leading at handstroke. Then the band has a handstroke and a backstroke to prepare to start moving around. However, on higher stages (or on heavier peals of bells), the call is often made a little later so as not to confuse the back bells, who are often finishing a backstroke as the treble starts the handstroke of the next row.1 I suggest watching what the other callers in your tower do, and see how it affects the start of the method. After a while watching, you’ll be able to get a sense for where to put this call to make it effective. When you go visiting, if you’re asked to call it’s wise to take a moment to think through how the differences in the bells may affect how you call. Louder bells or quieter voices, for example, may persuade you to make calls in the gaps between rows so that you can be heard sufficiently well.\nBob! or Single! This call tells your band that it’s time to change the pattern a little bit. In most methods, this call is made right before the row where the treble’s backstroke will be in 2; that is, a whole pull before the call will take effect. Sometimes the call can be made a little later. For example, a handbell caller may make the call in the middle of the row where the treble’s backstroke is in 2, since there is no need to give the heavy bells quite as much time to maneuver. A bob often means that the first and fourth bells stay where they are (\u0026ldquo;14 places\u0026rdquo;) but can also mean other things, depending on the method or principle. Similarly, a single often means that 1234 places are made; but sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Always make sure you know what type of bob or single is being used in a composition before you start and you\u0026rsquo;ll be alright.2\nThis will be all! or That’s all! This call (and variants thereof) tells your band to stop ringing the method and start ringing rounds again. This call has perhaps the most wiggle-room in terms of where to put it! If the touch is about to come round at a backstroke, some callers will say “That’s all!” right before the treble’s handstroke in 1 in the previous row, though I personally typically make the call later than that. Other callers will announce the coming rounds at the middle or end of the row where the treble’s handstroke was in 1. In other situations, especially if the touch is about to come round at handstroke, callers will announce “That’s all!” in the gap right before the bells come into rounds. In handbells, this call is not infrequently made as late as in the middle of the rounds themselves! When you are first learning to call, you are likely going to be calling a touch that comes round at backstroke. If you resolve to say “This will be all!” right before the treble’s handstroke in 1, even if you are a little late it will likely be fine.\nStand next! or Stand! This call lets the ringers know it’s time to set their bells. “Stand!” is often said at a similar point in the rounds to when “Go, next time!” is said, and for similar reasons; you need to give the back bells enough warning to prepare to set their bells, but not confuse anyone by calling it too early.\nIn the image to the right, you may have noticed that the text goes in between the rows of ringing, not directly on any given row. That\u0026rsquo;s because I personally think it\u0026rsquo;s easiest and clearest when the call is made between the rows, perhaps slightly overlapping the sound of the first bell. In practical terms, if you are ringing in 7ths place and hunting up while the treble is about to hunt down into 2 and you need to call a bob \u0026ndash; you might need to think fast! The place for the call should come when the treble is doing the relevant action, not necessarily when you are (not least because often, that changes from lead to lead!). Having extremely consistent timing for your calling will make your ringing much more stable and your band will thank you for it.\nTips for speaking clearly #  Speaking clearly and loudly enough is a must. If you’re uncertain about how loud to be, it’s better to err on the side of being too loud than too quiet to hear! Emphasizing the different numbers of syllables in “bob” and “single” can help ringers distinguish between the two even if they cannot hear you that well.\nCallers who are young or have higher-pitched voices may particularly struggle with being loud enough to be heard in the ringing chamber. In addition to the fact that many ringers are used to hearing low-pitched, adult voices give the calls, ringers that suffer from partial hearing loss will much more commonly have high-frequency hearing loss that affects their ability to hear higher-pitched voices. The solutions are to be as loud as you healthily can, to make calls during the handstroke gap wherever possible to reduce the noise of the bells during your calls, and to emphasize the consonants. If possible, you can also try to make eye contact with ringers who are Deaf or hard of hearing to make sure they can see your mouth move as you give the call.\nSummary #  Calls often go in a whole pull in advance, but there can be considerable variation depending on preference (and even region). The advice above holds for many common methods, like Plain Bob and various Surprise methods. Methods like Grandsire and principles like Stedman can operate somewhat differently, so if you’re called upon to call a touch of Grandsire or Stedman, make sure you are confident in knowing where the calls go in.\nResources #  If you want to know more about these definitions, or other ringing terms, you can try the following excellent resources:\n John Harrison\u0026rsquo;s Glossary of ringing terms CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing  Exercises #  This section also comes with a variety of exercises that can be tried at home or with other ringers.\nReview this #  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit dodgy about bobs and singles, try these review questions.

They’re just for fun, and can get good laughs from the whole tower!  While ringing rounds, the ringer of the treble says what they had for breakfast. Then, in ‘rounds order,’ everyone else says what they had for breakfast. While ringing rounds, the ringer of the treble says what they had for breakfast \u0026ndash; and then calls on another ringer at random! The game goes until everyone has been called. It requires concentration to remember who hasn’t been asked to speak yet!     If it’s not possible to ask your Tower Captain/Ringing Master for speaking practice, there are some other things you can try:  Practice speaking while ringing handbells (alone or with a band) Practice making calls to a band over Zoom. These calls can be made while you are ringing with the virtual ringing software of your choice. Practice speaking while ringing on a simulator or a dumbbell.  This isn’t the ideal set-up: the simulated ringers either won’t listen or they’ll put in the calls themselves! Some software allows you to mute the call sounds, but almost all have a visual cue in addition to the sound cue.      Notes #    You may not be familiar with what a \u0026ldquo;row\u0026rdquo; is. A row is something like 14235 or 81234567; it is an order in which the bells ring. It is colloquially called a change. By the Framework, a change is the transition of one row to the next row. The grid or place notation of a method describes its changes (abstract, about the transitions) rather than its rows (concrete, about the positions of the bells). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There are also non-standard calls like big bob, hic, extreme, and others. You may hear these, but more rarely, and usually the person calling will be very careful to tell the band beforehand if these are included!\n“Big bob” is often used to disambiguate between types of bobs if there are, for example, both 14 and 16-type bobs in a composition. I remember first learning of “big bobs” in relation to Surprise Major one summer, and shortly thereafter being encouraged to take hold to try London Surprise Major for the first time at a tower whose practice night I was visiting. At this time, I was mainly used to ringing plain courses or half courses of surprise methods in tower. The London went surprisingly well (to my mind), but when the conductor called “Little Bob!” after a few leads I panicked \u0026ndash; if bob is 14 and big bob is 16 then surely little bob must be 12?! \u0026ndash; this, as it turned out, was the correct answer for the lead end change, but it did not help with the resulting lead of what was supposed to be Little Bob Major! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/supplemental_skills/2_placing_your_band/','title':"Placing Your Band",'section':"Supplemental Skills",'content':"Placing Your Band #  Band placement is, I think, one of the trickier things that callers and conductors do (other than calling or conducting!). Not everyone chooses to place bands, for a variety of reasons, but many callers and conductors do choose to, especially for quarter peal and peal attempts.\nHowever, in my experience it\u0026rsquo;s rare that there is frank discussion of how exactly bands are placed. I think that a lot of this reluctance of discussion is due to the fact that it can be fairly socially tricky to place a band. A ringer might feel hurt if they are only ever asked to cover, or might be offended at being asked to treble when they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;perfectly able to ring inside, thank you very much!\u0026rdquo;. It can feel easy to ask the very agreeable ringers in your tower to do all the trebling and covering because they won\u0026rsquo;t complain about it, but is it serving their best interests and desires for progression?\nI am reminded of a time in college (university, for the Brits reading) where my friends and I were discussing how to assign different solos to different people in our Renaissance chamber choir. Someone said it was \u0026ldquo;like solving a jigsaw puzzle, but where all the pieces have feelings\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; a comparison which often feels very apt to me when placing a band.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m placing a band, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think about how to balance everyone\u0026rsquo;s needs and wants with my own desires for a certain standard of ringing, a certain method to be rung, or maybe something else entirely. Here are a few things that I think about when I\u0026rsquo;m placing a band; maybe you think about others, or in a very different order. If you have other things that come to mind, feel free to shoot me an email; I\u0026rsquo;m happy to update this space to be more inclusive to different philosophies.\nPlacing a stronger ringer or ringers #  If there is a ringer who is stronger than the rest of the band \u0026mdash; in terms of method confidence and ringing ability, not physical strength \u0026mdash; it can be useful to think about where to place them to best advantage. You can trust them not to go wrong (or at least trust them more than others) and so it\u0026rsquo;s worth taking time to consider where that would be best.\nEven though it\u0026rsquo;s less \u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo; for the strong ringer (and may seem counterintuitive), I often like to place a strong ringer on the treble. Having a steady treble can make a huge difference in the success of a quarter peal or peal attempt, and provides a rallying point. Being able to know with confidence when you shout \u0026ldquo;Half lead!\u0026rdquo; that the treble is, in fact, at the half lead, is extremely useful.\nThis choice can also be a convenient one, socially. The ringer in question will almost always know that they are one of the more confident in the band, and are therefore less likely to feel put out by your putting them on the treble. It is not a vote of no-confidence, it\u0026rsquo;s a vote of high confidence that they will be a steady and valuable member of the band!\nOther good places put place your relatively stronger ringers: on the affected bells of a composition (often the front bells), or on the very back bells (if they are steady back bell ringers, or if they want to work on their back bell ringing).\nPlacing a \u0026ldquo;stretchy\u0026rdquo; ringer or ringers #  Sometimes there will be a ringer, or several, who you suspect may struggle with something you want to call or conduct. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with this; it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly normal (and arguably desirable) to have a band with a range of abilities, and it\u0026rsquo;s part of your job as caller or conductor to make sure that all members of your band are supported, regardless of ability. Nonetheless, it can be a sensitive matter to place these ringers depending on their personality.\nThese ringers might struggle with certain aspects of the method or composition you have chosen. We can call these ringers \u0026ldquo;stretchy\u0026rdquo; in that they are stretching the limits of their abilities \u0026mdash; which is a great way to learn, after all!\nYou may choose to place them on the treble. If they are a strong treble ringer, this can be a great choice for your performance; however, if they are roughly equally adept at the treble and at inside ringing, I generally prefer to place them inside (if I have a choice; sometimes you may not have a choice if they don\u0026rsquo;t know the method you\u0026rsquo;re ringing, for example). Having a strong ringer on the treble is very valuable for stability.\nSimilarly, you may choose to place them on the cover; if this cannot be avoided then you should do it and not look back! I rang several quarter peals from the cover in my learning days when I was not yet ready to take a bell inside. It can be a really valuable experience for a stretchy ringer. However, if they are equally able to ring the cover and ring inside (certainly not always true), it may be more pleasant for them to have a chance to ring inside, and you can place a ringer with a strong sense of rhythm on the tenor.\nIf you are placing a stretchy ringer on the inside, consider who their course and after bells are being rung by. Setting up a band such that the stretchy ringers are coursing along with strong ringers can set you up for success.\nOther good places to put your stretchy ringers: on unaffected bells in the back (especially if you can \u0026ldquo;sandwich\u0026rdquo; the ringer between two more experienced ringers, or if you can make sure that their course and after bells are being rung by strong ringers), or on affected bells in the front where you can keep an eye on them. If you place them on a bell right next to you, you can also sometimes give quiet encouragement or advice without having to shout across the room. You can also choose to put them on the observation bell (rather than yourself on the observation bell), on the logic that you\u0026rsquo;ll probably know where the observation bell \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; to be most of the time! These depend on your preferences as conductor and the ringer\u0026rsquo;s preferences; there\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution but these are a set of thoughts to get you started.\nFurther social advice #  Sometimes the ringers \u0026mdash; regardless of where they fall in the spectrum of ability in your band \u0026mdash; will have a Very Strong Preference about where they want to ring. When this aligns with your preference, that is all very well! But sometimes their desires and yours can be at odds.\nMy first bit of advice in this case is not to ask where people want to ring unless you\u0026rsquo;re prepared to actually take their desires into account. Most of the time I find it simpler to assign bells and then, over the course of weeks or months, make sure to rotate people off and on the treble, tenor, cover, or inside working bells. I do this even when I am pretty sure that everyone in the band could equally well manage something, just to keep things equal. It is also sometimes helpful to assign bands in advance for things like quarter peals or peal attempts to give the opportunity for focused practice on a particular bell or pair of bells.\nSometimes, when you have assigned a band, someone will vocally disagree with you or complain, or even refuse to ring the bell that you have assigned them. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s difficult, I think the best thing to do in this circumstance is first to stop and take a look at your own behavior and think about whether you have done the right thing, in light of the complaint. Is this the fourth time you\u0026rsquo;ve put Avery on the treble tonight? Have you given all attempts at tenoring to the same two people all evening? Consider whether their complaint is reasonable, and then regardless I recommend you apologize and fix the band placement. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth fighting about ringing; it\u0026rsquo;s a hobby we\u0026rsquo;re all supposed to enjoy! If possible, follow up with the ringer later (privately) and see what you can do to remediate the situation.\nIt may be frustrating to deal with some of the types of complaints, and they may seem unreasonable to you. Perhaps you have a ringer who will only ring the 2nd and will vehemently complain when assigned to another bell. Or maybe you have a ringer who purses their lips and sighs loudly every time they are asked to cover. This aspect of calling and conducting is, I think, one of the most difficult bits. It can be upsetting when people are angry or frustrated with you, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re doing all you can to support the development of the band as a whole. See if you can accommodate all requests, within reason, and occasionally ask if the ringer would like a chance to try something new (unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been told not to ask, of course). I think that being kind and supportive is the only thing you can do in such a situation.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/supplemental_skills/3_giving_guidance/','title':"Giving Guidance",'section':"Supplemental Skills",'content':"Giving Guidance #  There are many opportunities for a caller or conductor to give guidance. These may be as simple as a short reminder about the composition before beginning a touch, or may be as complex as giving instructions about the coursing orders during a peal attempt. Here are some thoughts about the different times and manners in which callers and conductors give guidance.\nBefore the ringing #  Everyone has a different philosophy about how much guidance to give before a touch, or a quarter peal or peal attempt. Often, for a touch, there is some chatter about the method beforehand, and then every catches hold and the most that anyone in the band knows is \u0026ldquo;Go, Plain Bob Minor!\u0026rdquo; before the bobs start flying. This works well if everyone knows exactly what the bobs and singles for that method are (though if they are \u0026ldquo;nonstandard\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means for your tower, you should give guidance before you start). For a quarter peal or peal, depending on the interests of the ringers, often more guidance is given.\nPersonally: If I think that at least one other ringer will be interested to know what the composition is \u0026mdash; whether they are learning to conduct or whether they know how to conduct and want to watch it as it goes by \u0026mdash; I share some relevant information with the band before we start. If it\u0026rsquo;s a short touch I might just share the touch. For a longer composition, some types of things I might share include:\n How many parts are there? What are the part ends like? Are there bobs and singles or just bobs or just singles? Is it mostly bobs but a single at middle and end? Are there any particular features that people should watch out for? For example, are some handbell pairs preserved (but swapped) part-to-part, or is there some interesting symmetry? Are there any unusual calls? If there is any ambiguity about the call type (are singles 1234 or 1678?), I make sure to specify before we begin, even if the band were given the information in an email beforehand. Not worth the risk of a fire-up! If you\u0026rsquo;re ringing spliced, the name of the first method, and maybe a quick re-cap of the other methods involved (Something like \u0026ldquo;Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s the 14, not the 10\u0026rdquo; will do in many cases; or if you\u0026rsquo;re only ringing a few, reminding by method name).  During the ringing #  You\u0026rsquo;re done with rounds and you\u0026rsquo;re off! I think for most conductors the ideal circumstance is to not have to provide any guidance other than the calls at the correct place. In reality, however, it is very common for conductors to give periodic comments throughout the ringing. In most circumstances, in fact, it is usual for the conductor to be the only one expected to make such comments.\nHere are a few things you might say during conducting, which aren\u0026rsquo;t related to the bobs, singles, or other calls:\n \u0026ldquo;Lead end here!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Half lead here!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Four should be coursing the six!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Finish your whole turn on the front!\u0026rdquo;  And on and on. There are a variety of small corrective comments (or just comments on landmarks) that may be useful. It is my experience that when giving these comments, one is often under some amount of stress (trying to keep the method and the composition in one\u0026rsquo;s head while saying the comment and watching the result is quite a lot of mental effort!) and it is sometimes too easy to slip into yelling, somewhat grumpily, at the rest of the ringers in the circle.\nPersonally, I do not care much for grumpy yelling. I do not know what other ringers say about me in the pub when I\u0026rsquo;m not there (nor do I hope to!), but I aspire to be the sort of conductor where they say things like \u0026ldquo;Even when she\u0026rsquo;s telling me I missed a dodge, she\u0026rsquo;s so nice about it!\u0026rdquo;.\nHere are some of the things I do to make giving guidance during the ringing more pleasant for everyone:\n When possible, I try to give more structural guidance than individual guidance. That is, I will tell the band where the treble is, or what places are being made, rather than singling out the person who has failed to dodge with the treble, or make the place. Sometimes this works, and sometimes this doesn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026mdash; if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work then I will change my strategy for the rest of the ringing. When individual guidance cannot be avoided, I try to be polite about it. Think about how you would tell a work colleague that they had missed out a column in the spreadsheet; then think about how you tell a fellow ringer (and likely friend!) that they had missed out a dodge. It seems to me to be ideal to be at least as nice to the fellow ringer. So I will say something like \u0026ldquo;Four, finish your lead please\u0026rdquo; (if I can spare the syllable for please!) Make eye contact if possible, and try for a smile; I know it\u0026rsquo;s hard when concentrating but it does make a difference. Give encouragement as well as guidance. If there has just been a shaky section, let the band know that everyone\u0026rsquo;s in the right place again with a happy \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right!\u0026rdquo;. Give a smile to a band member when they dodge with you or hunt past.  When two bells are swapped #  Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s obvious when the ringing has gone wrong; bells are all over each other and it\u0026rsquo;s lumpy, or there may be firing. Sometimes, however, it can be much more subtle. A minor kerfuffle at a lead end you might think has straightened itself out \u0026mdash; only to find half a lead later that two bells are swapped. This, in my experience, is the most common way that the ringing can be \u0026ldquo;subtly\u0026rdquo; wrong. Some conductors would immediately stand the touch up at this point, but I often prefer to instead try to set it straight quickly if possible.\nIt may be that your first impulse is to immediately shout out that the two bells are swapped. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t always the right choice depending on your band. Here are some options that I generally weigh when I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about when to speak:\n You could wait to tell the ringers until the next lead end, and tell them what their work should be and what their place bell should be. This option can be great if you have the spare brain power to figure out what their new place bells or work should be. It reduces any chance of confusion. You could wait to tell the ringers until they are ringing near each other, then let them know that they are swapped and what work they should do next. A particularly convenient place to do this can be when they come down to the front, especially to lead full. If the 2 and 3 are over and the 3 is heading down too quickly, let the 2 know that it\u0026rsquo;s their turn to lead and tell the 3 to lead next. There will be a whole pull or two of chaos but then generally things will straighten out. You could decide not to wait to tell the ringers, and just let them know as soon as you figure it out. This can work, depending on your band. Sometimes ringers are very good at figuring out where they ought to be, or pulling their bells where they ought to be. In handbell ringing in particular this isn\u0026rsquo;t a terrible option, necessarily, though I\u0026rsquo;d argue it\u0026rsquo;s less ideal than the above. In tower bell ringing, however, you could be giving your ringers a very difficult task. If the two swapped bells are at opposite ends of the row, chaos (and possibly firing) will ensue as the bells attempt to swap places, probably confusing other ringers in the process. The matter is even more difficult if the bells are at all heavy or difficult to ring.  When it\u0026rsquo;s all going wrong #  Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just that two bells have quietly swapped places at a bob; sometimes chaos breaks out everywhere at once. How long do you let it continue? It\u0026rsquo;s a very difficult judgement call, and your judgement abilities will definitely grow with time and experience.\nPersonally, I still find it a complicated and difficult choice. Different regions, conductors, and ringers all have their own level of tolerance, and it varies based on when you\u0026rsquo;re ringing and what for. On a practice night? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s okay to crash about a bit for a bit until it becomes clear it\u0026rsquo;s unproductive, or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s okay to let two bells be swapped for a while. On a Sunday? Perhaps better to stand it up if it\u0026rsquo;s not going to sound very nice, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re ringing the last touch before the service starts (and note for next time to choose something less ambitious!). For a quarter peal or peal attempt? Here you will get ringers with stronger opinions. An unwritten, but common, guideline is that the bells ought not to be swapped or crashing for more than a full lead.\nNow, we must apply common sense to this guideline (like all guidelines). If you are a local band who is working up to your first ever local quarter peal, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s okay to deal with a lead and a half of swapped-over bells. If you\u0026rsquo;re most of the way through some tricky, tricky peal of spliced major, maybe you can stretch it a little as well. But you\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure others in the band feel the same way, and avoid the terrible fate of having someone else stand their bell in protest (although I would argue they are being quite rude by doing so \u0026ndash; voicing your opinion that it ought not to count can happen after the ringing rather than during).\nAs a note, I have sometimes let a performance go on when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether or not two bells had gotten swapped, or some other mistake had happened. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget a coursing order in the middle of something; it happens to everyone. This happened to me somewhat recently, in fact, and it was disappointing when we got to the last little bit and I realized that two bells had, in fact, been swapped for some time. I told them to swap right before the rounds at the end of our quarter attempt. We didn\u0026rsquo;t count it as a quarter, but we still had a good time and got a lot of practice in \u0026ndash; and we scored it the next time.\nAfter the ringing #  After the ringing, I always try to say something encouraging \u0026mdash; even if the ringing didn\u0026rsquo;t quite go. Complimenting a particularly well-struck section or the hard efforts of the ringers goes a long way towards softening the blow of a failed attempt. Of course if the ringing did go, there\u0026rsquo;s at least one encouraging thing to say! So do it. I try to leave the post-mortem of all of the slips and trips to the pub if I can, and never call out individuals.\nIt is slightly different after a practice night touch. You may want to talk to an individual ringer about their performance and how they might improve. In such a case, I recommend privately going up to them and asking if they would like feedback on their ringing. They may say yes \u0026mdash; and they may say no, which must be respected also.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/calling/2_simple_touches/','title':"Simple Touches",'section':"Calling",'content':"Simple Touches #  In this section, we’ll be covering some short and simple touches you can use for practice. This section will focus on touches that are short enough that it is practical to discuss which call is made at each lead, leaving discussions of “calling positions” (such as In, Wrong, or Make) for a later submodule. Examples are focused on various stages of Plain Bob as well as a few other common methods, with a few short touches of Grandsire included. It is my hope to add more complete supplemental sections for Grandsire as well as Stedman and Erin in the coming months.\nWhat Makes a Touch #  Here we’ll be learning about calling using very simple compositions which are limited to a single method and a small number of calls. When one rings a composition, the result is called a touch. Today we’ll discuss short touches, which are shorter than a quarter peal in length (less than 1250 changes), but our focus will be on very short touches that are easy to memorize and practice.1\nSo, what makes a touch a touch, and why can’t you just call bob at random times while ringing and just enjoy the ride? Well, you can of course, but you risk violating one of several conventions that many people like to keep to when ringing:\n A touch should be true. Truth is defined rigorously by the Framework, but in common parlance a true touch does not repeat any row except that the last row is the same as the first. Some conductors are very good at improvising a composition which is true, while ringing, but to my knowledge very few start out that way \u0026mdash; so it’s easiest to keep to known compositions at the beginning. A touch should start and end with rounds. A touch will ideally avoid rows that end with 65 at backstroke (in minor) or 87 (in major), etc. Rows with 65s or 87s at back are thought to be unmusical.  Are the above guidelines set in stone? No, they are not, and people do sometimes ignore them for a variety of reasons. Some people don’t bother ensuring the truth or musicality of every practice night touch as long as it’s useful for some other pedagogical purpose. Starting a composition from a place other than rounds can also be a useful pedagogical tool. However, most of the time, most callers and conductors keep to true, musical compositions that start and end with rounds; so I’ll give you a few of those here to practice with.\nA first touch #  In my experience, it is traditional for a ringer’s first experience calling to happen as an immediate consequence of some tower captain saying something like: “Well, have you ever called a touch? I know a simple one of bob doubles, it’s just…”\nPerhaps you’ve had that experience and perhaps you haven’t; in any case, I wouldn’t want to deprive you.\nWell, have you ever called a touch? I know a simple one of bob doubles, it’s just 2 bobs in a row! Yes, that’s right, just catch hold of the treble there. Call a bob every time you pull your backstroke in two. (Here another ringer helpfully interjects: “But only do it twice! And when you get to rounds don’t forget to say that’s all!”). Ready? Go!\n For a first touch, I like to suggest that the ringer choose a method they (and ideally, everyone in their band) is comfortable with. For many bands, Plain Bob Doubles is a natural choice, so the first touch that we discuss here will be this simple (if not easy, for the first-timer!) touch of Plain Bob Doubles. Touches of other methods are given below if you are part of a band that prefers other methods.\nAs mentioned above, this first touch consists of two bobs, right in a row with one another. That is, when you get to the end of the first lead, you’ll say “bob”; at the end of that lead, you’ll say “bob” a second and final time; and the bells will pull into rounds at the backstroke of the treble’s lead.\nVery short touches are often notated this way:\n Plain Bob Doubles\n20 bb\n The method is given, the “20” shows how many rows there are in the composition (not counting the one that’s repeated), and each ‘b’ represents a lead with a \u0026ldquo;bob\u0026rdquo; called during the lead end. In Calling It Round, \u0026ldquo;lead end\u0026rdquo; will refer to the two rows of the treble\u0026rsquo;s lead and the change between them. This is a common, but slightly imprecise,2 usage of the term and not everyone does it this way3\nI really like this touch as a first touch, and let me tell you why.\n It’s easy to memorize It’s a method that is comfortable for many ringers It’s very short, so you definitely have time to try it again It’s a treat to ring from the treble. You don’t have to remember what to do at a bob while also calling a bob; you can practice just one thing at a time.  Compositions like this, where you make the call ‘bob’ at every lead, are called bob courses. A bob course can also be a touch that is the same length as the plain course, but has bob and plain leads in it. Many of the simple touches I’ll present below are bob courses!\nSeveral more short practice night touches #  These practice night touches were chosen for being short (so that they can be put in notation that is easy-to-read) and for being true in commonly-rung methods. For each touch in this table, I put the method, the number of rows, the composition, and some notes. Calling from the treble is appropriate for every touch; calling from an inside bell will be easier for some touches than others, and this fact is noted where appropriate.\nA brief side note: I know that many bands ring a good deal of Grandsire. Grandsire is a lovely method! However, it does behave somewhat differently to Plain Bob and the other methods I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on here. I am going to include a few Grandsire compositions below, but I\u0026rsquo;m really not doing it justice; I want to add an entire supplemental section (or whole chapter?) on Grandsire at some point in the future. For now, if you want to try calling some Grandsire, here\u0026rsquo;s the most relevant difference at this stage: The calls are made at the treble\u0026rsquo;s handstroke in 3 (a whole pull before they take effect: right before the lead end).\nIn this table, ‘b’ is for ‘bob’; ‘s’ is for ‘single’; and ‘p’ is for ‘plain’ (no call). Spaces are not meaningful; they just chunk up the composition so patterns are easier to spot.\n   Method Length Composition Notes     Plain Bob Doubles 20 bb Called from the 2 or 3, you plain hunt the whole time.   Plain Bob Doubles 60 pb pb pb Called from the 4, you make every bob.   Grandsire Doubles 20 bb A bob course of Grandsire Doubles \u0026ndash; everyone\u0026rsquo;s affected!   Grandsire Doubles 60 pb pb pb Called from the 5, this is known as \u0026ldquo;calling yourself half hunt\u0026rdquo;. You do the same work every two leads.   Grandsire Doubles 120 pb pb ps pb pb ps Turns the previous touch into an extent.   Plain Bob Minor 72 ppb ppb Called from the 4, you make every bob.

Kent Treble Bob Major 96 bbb Easiest from the treble or the back 4 bells. Often called \u0026ldquo;Three leads of Kent\u0026rdquo;.    This collection is a very cursory look at some simple touches, but there are many collections of touches using this notation that you can use as you begin to practice calling. I will cover other excellent resources for compositions such as CompLib or ringing.org at a later time. For now, I recommend the following sites for collections of simple touches:\n Cambridge District Touches and Compositions The Banners' Touches Collection  I’m sure there are other wonderful resources for touches using this notation out there; go forth and find! If you are the finder or creator of such a resource, please feel free to reach me and I will add it to this space.\nAside on notation: Note that the Banners' site contains touches in a very slightly different format. There, you read the calls off the left-hand column of the touch. A hyphen ‘-’ is a bob, an ‘s’ is a single, and a blank space indicates a plain. For example, consider the touch below: a 60 of Plain Bob Doubles from their site.\n  Ignoring the numbers on the right-hand side, and focusing on just the left-hand annotations between the 4-dash lines, you can see a blank space (a plain) followed by a ‘-’ (bob), repeated twice to give “ - - -” or what we saw above as “pbpbpb”. Remember that the spaces in my table didn’t have meaning, they were just separators to show the pattern, so “pbpbpb” is the same as “pb pb pb”. The asterisk by the 60 indicates that the touch has been checked and is true. The authors also helpfully note some of the musical rows that turn up in the touch; here, Reverse Rounds (543216) and Kings (531246).\nExercises #  Try this #  Try calling the simple ‘bb’ touch of Plain Bob Doubles. You can either practice at your home tower or handbell practice, or online \u0026mdash; Ringing Room supports calling bobs, and can supply “robot ringers” that respond to you if you’d rather practice by yourself at first. If possible, ask an experienced caller or conductor to “shadow” the composition, or watch over the ringing while you are calling. They can help you if you get muddled, and give you advice afterwards on how to improve. And of course, if at first you don’t succeed: try, try again!\nWrite this #  This exercise is designed to help you work out the “bones” of a composition, including how to tell which bells will be “easier” or “harder” to call from.\nHere’s a composition of Plain Bob Minor: bbb. How many changes long is this touch? Don’t forget: traditionally, we don’t include the repeated row of rounds in this total. Write out the touch, including all of the rows. What do you notice about the path of the 2? The 3? Which bell makes each bob?\nCompose this #  You’ve seen a few simple touches \u0026mdash; and you are beginning to develop skills that will help you compose short touches yourself. These skills may be useful (or just fun to develop!) as you progress.\nThe composition ‘bb’ results in a true touch of Plain Bob Doubles. The composition ‘bbb’ results in a true touch of Plain Bob Minor. Can you write down a bobs-only, true composition for Plain Bob Triples? What about Major? Advanced: Write a sentence or two about the patterns you notice across all of these compositions. Which bells make the bobs? Which don’t?\nNote that in general, two examples do not a pattern make, and patterns are not always so obvious. But symmetry and patterns form a large part of the basis for composing, and are I think one of the most beautiful parts of ringing.\nNotes #    Touches can be very short or very long. A peal is a type of touch! However, when most people refer to ringing a touch on, say, a practice night, they are referring to a reasonably short length of ringing; maybe 15 or 20 minutes. Most ringers (and tower captains!) would be annoyed if you told them you were going to call a touch and then you called a peal-length touch! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There is not wide agreement on exactly where a lead begins and ends, and exactly which changes are contained in a lead, though there are two common groups of thought (and, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, other groups of thought that are less common!).4 While it is generally agreed upon that the lead end row is technically the row containing the treble’s handstroke lead, the term “lead end” in common usage refers more often to either the two rows in the treble’s lead (in this case, 165432 and 164523) and/or to the lead end change itself, that is, the change that results in the transformation from the lead end row to the lead head row.\n \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Here\u0026rsquo;s some of my reasoning for this decision, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious. In the ringing chamber, it is relatively unusual to hear the words lead head shouted (unless ringers are somewhat heatedly discussing a composition in advance of starting ringing!). As a general rule: If one is thinking about composing, one will likely want to remember the exact distinction between lead heads and lead ends. If one is thinking about conducting, likely one will ignore the fine distinctions and think about the more general, broad use of the term lead end to mean the last two rows in a lead and the change between them. As this publication has the teaching of calling and conducting as its primary aim, I will use the broad sense of lead end throughout, only referring to lead heads where it would otherwise be confusing to the reader. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Here are the two main philosophical camps I see in popular use:\n Camp 1: The lead head of this lead is rounds, and rounds is the first row in the lead. The last row in the lead is the row 165432, and therefore the lead is contained between two different times the treble is leading (the end of its lead, and the beginning of its next lead, inclusive). This interpretation is intuitive from a graphical perspective (starts when the treble is in 1, ends when the treble is in 1) and allows for the lead head and lead end both being included in the actual lead.\nCamp 2: The lead head of this lead is rounds, but rounds is not contained in the lead itself. Rather, the lead consists of all of the rows that result from the application of the changes of the method to the lead head. The last row in the lead is therefore 164523, which is also the lead head of the next lead. This interpretation is consistent with the CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing and with the way many people think about splicing methods; it is also the interpretation that I personally favor. (A mathematical aside: under this interpretation of a lead, a method is a function from a lead head to a set of rows) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/conducting/3_transposing_coursing_orders/','title':"Transposing Coursing Orders",'section':"Conducting",'content':"Transposing Coursing Orders #  You might\u0026rsquo;ve felt a bit suspicious in the last section about my proposed use for coursing orders in conducting. I suggested that if you know the coursing order, you can watch how you pass the bells around you and thereby set people straight if you are passing them in an order that is not the correct coursing order.\nIn the plain course, knowing the coursing order is as easy as memorizing a short string of numbers, often in a very pleasing order (with such helpful mnemonics as \u0026ldquo;up the odds, down the evens!\u0026quot;). The trick is knowing the coursing orders when you\u0026rsquo;re 7 calls in to a quarter of Plain Bob, nowhere near the plain course.\nOne way to do this is by straight memorization, and doing some memorization of coursing orders at certain signposts (e.g. the halfway point, or a particularly tricky section) can be useful. The more flexible but definitely harder approach is to learn how to transpose1 the coursing orders as you ring and call, so you can keep a constant check on the ringing as you go.\nCalls and coursing orders #  Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about a few common calls and how those affect the coursing order. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Plain Bob Minor again as our example, because there\u0026rsquo;s only a few bells to keep track of.\nWrong #  Below is a picture of two lead of Plain Bob Major, starting in the plain course with a coursing order of 5324. There is a bob called at Wrong; what\u0026rsquo;s the resulting coursing order? Use the convention of giving the coursing order relative to the 6, but with the 6 omitted. When you\u0026rsquo;ve finished, scroll down to read more.\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise   Coursing Order Submit    In the example given above, the coursing order changed from 5324 (the plain course coursing order) to 3254. Notice that the 4 stayed in the same place, but the other bells swapped position. In particular, they swapped like this:\n So the bell in the \u0026ldquo;front\u0026rdquo; of the coursing order (the 5) got moved two places back and shuffled everything else around accordingly. Note that the 5 is actually the bell that made the bob! And the other two bells that \u0026ldquo;moved\u0026rdquo; in the coursing order were the other bells affected in the bob.\nThe amazing thing about viewing a bob as a transposition of a coursing order is that it works at every calling position. All that happens when you move calling positions is that you move which bells are affected by the transposition; but the shape of the thing \u0026ndash; the directions the arrows point and how many there are \u0026ndash; remain the same. When you see:\n You can confidently know that there was a call at Wrong, even if the starting coursing order were different. It is definitional: at a Wrong, the first three bells in the coursing order (written by this convention) are transposed. In this case, it\u0026rsquo;s the 532. A further pattern: when there is a bob, the way the three bells move about tells you what they do at that bob. In this case, the 5 made it, the 3 ran out, and the 2 ran in. And no matter what the coursing order is, this will work! If you start with 2354 and make a call at Wrong, you will get 3524; the 2 will make it, the 3 will run out, and the 5 will run in. These patterns are part of what make learning about coursing orders so useful.\nHome #  So with that weighty knowledge in hand, let\u0026rsquo;s try our trick again, but with a bob at Home. Remember to use the same convention as before: don\u0026rsquo;t include the treble or the tenor in your coursing order answer.\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise   Coursing Order Submit    Here the coursing order changed from 5324 (the plain course coursing order) to 5243. Unlike in the bob at Wrong example, here the first bell in the order (the 5) stayed put and the other bells swapped around:\n Notice: the number and direction of the arrows is the same, but the bells to which they apply are different. So the different calling positions (where the tenor is unaffected) affect different sets of bells, but the bobs affect those bells in the same way. A bob in Plain Bob moves one bell behind its two right-most neighbors. This is true as long as the tenor is not one of the bells affected in the bob, as you might imagine!\nNotice that bobs affect three bells, in a cyclic way. What would happen if you called a bob at Home three times? You may remember the answer from earlier in Calling It Round, but writing it out is good practice. You\u0026rsquo;ll find that the bells cycle back to the plain course coursing order after exactly 3 bobs. This feature of bobs affecting three bells in the coursing order is why bobs are commonly found in groups of three; it brings you back to where you started without repeating.\nBefore #  This is a slightly trickier case, because in a call at Before, the tenor is affected; it runs out. Can you spot the coursing order after the bob at Before?\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise   Coursing Order Submit    Yes, here the coursing order changed from 5324 (the plain course coursing order) to 5432. I find this particular transposition is often confusing because there\u0026rsquo;s so much happening in the calculation; even though the 5 looks like it didn\u0026rsquo;t move in the coursing order from the numbers on the page, it was involved in the bob \u0026mdash; and I just told you that the ones involved in the bob would be the ones that moved! What gives?\nWe can figure it out by looking at the full coursing order, including the 6. Remember how we talked about the limitations of Western left-to-right notation? This is another time where we will run into that issue. Recall that we can write the coursing order 53246 (the plain course coursing order) as 32465 if it suits our fancy, because it\u0026rsquo;s really a cycle of numbers and not a line. Here\u0026rsquo;s what happened to the full coursing order, including the 6:\n But since the 6 moved, when we re-write the coursing order using the convention that we put the 6 silently at the end, we go through the following process:\n   Operation Coursing order     [start in plain course] 5324   Add the 6 back in 53246   Put the 5 at the back because it\u0026rsquo;s part of the bob, and it is easiest to visualize when it is next to the other bells that will be part of the bob (the 4 and 6) 32465   Bob at Before 32654   Move the 6 to the end 54326   Ignore the 6 (remove it) 5432    So even though the 5 ran in at the bob, it looks \u0026ldquo;stationary\u0026rdquo; in the coursing order (using these common conventions).\nSome people can do all of these transformations and operations in their head very quickly. It takes practice but it is possible! Others take some shortcuts, and I admit I am one when it comes to bobs at Before. I prefer to think of it as the 4 (who made the bob), \u0026ldquo;cutting in line\u0026rdquo; in front of the 3 and 2. This is not actually what\u0026rsquo;s happening, since the 3 and 2 are not involved in the bob! But it makes for a quick mental transposition when ringing. Different people figure out different approaches that work for them.\nSingle #  The final thing we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss in this section is the effect of a single at Home. the 6 is not affected, so we have a slightly easier job of things. See if you can work out the effect of the single at Home here. It starts in the plain course.\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise   Coursing Order Submit    Here the coursing order changed from 5324 (the plain course coursing order) to 5423. That\u0026rsquo;s new! Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at how the arrows go:\n Here, only two bells are being swapped. That\u0026rsquo;s because, at the call, two bells are being stopped from dodging with each other in 3 4 and are instead making places in 3 and 4. The bell in 2nds place is making seconds as usual, and the bells in the back are dodging as usual. So in Plain Bob, singles only affect 2 bells.\nTake a moment and consider what happens if you ring two singles at Home. Write it out if you need to. That\u0026rsquo;s right \u0026ndash; you end up back where you started. Two singles at Home will give you a true, two-course touch of Plain Bob Minor. The fact that singles affect two bells in the coursing order by swapping them is why singles in compositions often come in pairs.\nOther things to know #  I have covered a relatively limited set of information about transposition of coursing orders; just a few calling positions and two types of calls. But this should be enough to get you started! Just be aware that calls at different calling positions may affect the way the transposition works in your head, especially when the heaviest bell is affected \u0026ndash; like we saw above with the Before. Calls at the same calling position \u0026ndash; even in a different method! \u0026ndash; mean the same thing for the transposition. The nearly-universal nature of this pattern is what makes it so useful.2\nCoursing orders on higher numbers #  In minor, I like to write the coursing orders as 4-bell coursing orders, such as 5324, because that covers all of the working bells except the heaviest one, which is often fixed. Others will write out the full thing: 53246. In major, even though you add two bells, it is common to write a 5-bell coursing order, omitting both the 7 and the 8. So for example, the \u0026ldquo;usual\u0026rdquo; coursing order of bells in Plain Bob Major would be commonly written as 53246. There is an implied 7 and 8 in there (I usually think of it as [7]53246[8] but others prefer to think of it as [87]53246 \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s all preference).\nOn still higher stages like Royal or Maximus, it is still common to have only a 5 or 6 bell coursing order. This is because many composers choose to create compositions that only affect the front bells even when many bells are being rung. It saves space to write down only those bells which will actually be changing over the course of the composition. However, sometimes you will still see very large coursing orders given for larger stages.\nResources #  Print #  If you are looking for a book full of other exercises on transposing coursing orders in a variety of methods, John Longridge\u0026rsquo;s Conducting \u0026amp; Coursing Order is the best one I know. He uses a slightly different convention where the Plain Hunt coursing order is given as 8753246 (but most of the time, omitting the 8 and 7, so it looks like what we have covered here: 53246).\nOnline #  Once again I have an excellent set of blog posts from Simon Gay to recommend you (the end of the series on conducting techniques that I recommended before):\nDynamic use of coursing order\nStatic use of coursing order\nNotes #    If transpose isn\u0026rsquo;t a familiar word to you, here\u0026rsquo;s a definition: transpose means to change things around. It can have a more technical meaning if you\u0026rsquo;re using it in mathematics, but that\u0026rsquo;s the general meaning. Changing bells from the order 243 to 234 is a transposition. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Unfortunately, in a small number of cases, the pattern does break. Either through differences in conventions or just mistakes, there are published compositions that use the same calling position to mean transposing different bells to \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; (as defined above). This is most apparent with the definition of Middle in triples compositions, but can be seen elsewhere as well. It\u0026rsquo;s not very common, but it does warrant a warning. Also, as we mentioned in the Calling chapter, sometimes the same word can mean different things in different contexts! Sometimes a bob is 14 and sometimes 16; sometimes singles are 1234 and sometimes 1678. The names of calling positions can also occasionally be ambiguous or different for some methods, though rarely. As ever, when in doubt, check with the conductor or composer. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/calling/3_demystifying_in_out_make/','title':"Demystifying \"In, Out, Make\"",'section':"Calling",'content':"Demystifying “In, Out, Make”: The most common calling positions #  In this section, we’ll start to build the vocabulary and skills you’ll need to call longer and more complicated touches. When touches are longer than a few leads, it quickly becomes tiresome to memorize a long series of “plain, bob, bob, plain, bob, plain…”. To fix that problem, callers and conductors often use calling positions to help them remember where to put in the calls. We’ll first define calling positions and then tell you about some of the most common ones. In Calling It Round, we will mostly be covering methods like Plain Bob or Cambridge Surprise, which are methods with a single hunt bell, the treble. I hope to add supplements about Grandsire (a method with two hunt bells) and Stedman (a principle), so stay tuned if those interest you! Knowing this vocabulary will give you access to a much bigger number of compositions! In the next section, we’ll get down to brass tacks learning new compositions using this new vocabulary.\nCourses and Calling Positions #  A plain course is a course of a method where there is no call at any lead end. However, callers and conductors often talk about courses which may or may not have calls in them. A course of this type starts when a tenor is in its home or natural position (in Plain Bob Minor, this is being in 6ths place at the backstroke of the lead end), and ends when the tenor has returned to its natural position. At some point, you have likely seen the plain course of a method written out like this:\n  You’ll probably recognize this as Plain Bob Minor; there’s a treble (red line) plain hunting, and a bunch of other bells all dodging at the lead end (except one which is making seconds). Note that the tenor starts in 6ths place at the treble\u0026rsquo;s backstroke lead during rounds, and returns to 6ths place at the treble\u0026rsquo;s final backstroke lead in rounds.\nIn a tiny font off to the right hand side of each lead, you can see letters pointing to a particular place in the lead. These letters are shorthand for the names of various calling positions relative to a specific observation bell. Here, the observation bell is the tenor, in blue. An observation bell is a bell that you watch while you figure out where the calls go in a composition.\nA calling position is a position in the blue line (of the observation bell) where a call may be made.1 You can see that the hyphen next to the letter indicates the position in the row where the call would be made; it would then be executed at the treble’s lead. For convenience, many methods and principles have named calling positions. In the image above, five of these named calling positions are labelled: Wrong (W), Fourths (F), Before (B), In (I), and Home (H). In this section, I will always spell out the whole name, but give the common abbreviation in parentheses after. The calling positions in the diagram refer to the position that the observation bell (here, the tenor) would be in if a call were to be made. This fact can feel a bit unintuitive, because the plain course is written out such that there is a plain at every lead, but the calling positions refer to what would happen if a call were made.2 Let’s work our way through those calling positions with that in mind:\n   Calling Position(s) Abbr Definition (with tenor as observation bell)     Home H This calling position is the one where the tenor ends up at home (the 6th bell ending up in 6th place) at the lead end if a call is made.   In I This calling position is the one where the tenor would end up running in if a call were made.   Out (Sometimes: Before) O or B This calling position is the one where the tenor would end up running out if a call were made. It is sometimes known as “Before” because it happens when the tenor is coursing before the treble.   Make (Sometimes: Fourths) M3 or F If a call is made here, the tenor will make fourths.   Wrong4 W If a call is made here, the tenor winds up in 5ths at the backstroke of the lead end (by either dodging or hunting!). More generally, if a method is being rung on a stage with n bells, the calling position where the tenor ends up at position (n-1) is called Wrong (W). For example, in Plain Bob Major, if the tenor winds up in 7 after the call, the call was made at Wrong.    These calling positions \u0026mdash; Home (H), In (I), Out (O), Before (B), Make (M), Fourths (F), and Wrong (W) \u0026mdash; make up the majority of calling positions used in most compositions. Be aware that these named calling positions may change, unfortunately, from method to method (or principle), or from stage to stage. Worse, the abbreviations are not always unique; most important to be aware of is that (M) may mean either make (make fourths) or middle, which we haven’t discussed yet since it only comes up in higher stages.\nWith only 7 new words in your arsenal, you now have access to a huge number of compositions. For example, a great source of short touches is the Ringing World diary, a new edition of which is released each year; many compositions in the diary use only these calls, and the next section will introduce you to some of those compositions to help you get started.\nFrequently Asked Questions #  What does it mean if someone asks me to “call a Wrong”? #  This phrase is often shorthand for “call a bob at the calling position Wrong”. The phrase “call a single Wrong” most often means to call a single at the Wrong.\nWhen do I use Out vs Before? Or Make vs Fourths? #  Out and Before are two different names for the same calling position relative to the position of the observation bell; they both refer to a place in the lead where calling “bob” would lead to the observation bell running out. As a general (though not perfect) rule, methods that have a bell making seconds at the lead end use the names Before and Fourths, and methods that have plain hunt at the lead end use the names Out and Make. There are exceptions to this rule; for example, the calling positions in some doubles methods (including Plain Bob Doubles) are In, Out, and Make5 even though a bell makes seconds at the lead end. Always make sure to check you know what the calling positions mean for the method and composition you are using.\nHow does my understanding of calling positions change if the observation bell is not the tenor? #  As discussed above, an observation bell is the bell that you are watching (and perhaps ringing) to figure out where the calls go. In the diagram above, the tenor is the observation bell. Other bells can also serve as observation bells, but the calling position names remain the same. For example, if you are “ringing 4 as observation,” the call made at the position Home (H) will be made right before the 4 dodges into 6th place at the treble’s backstroke lead. This point is especially important to be aware of if you are hoping to call from a smaller bell.\nDoes this mean I can ring a composition from any bell as observation, not just the tenor? #  Yes and no. Some compositions are suitable to be rung with any bell as observation. However, most compositions are written with the tenor as observation, and often this is for good reason; the same composition with a different bell as observation may have undesirable musical qualities or other, bigger problems. If you’re planning on calling a composition in a different way to how it was set down by the composer, always check to make sure the resulting ringing will still be what you want it to be. In the Conducting section Round the Circle, I will cover this topic in more detail.\nWhere do I go to learn more about calling positions? #  It is likely that there is at least one ringer in your local area who is happy to talk you through all your questions. However, there are other great resources to learn more:\n Steve Coleman’s The Bob Caller’s Companion, a great general-purpose resource for those learning to call Tina Stoecklin and Simon Gay’s Change-Ringing on Handbells (Volume 1: Basic Techniques), another good general resource but focussed more on handbells John Harrison’s Glossary, especially for looking up the names or abbreviations of other calling positions  I’m sure there are many others. If you are aware of (or author of!) any other resources you’d like to make people aware of, please contact me and I will add it to this space.\nExercises #  Quiz This #  Assume all questions refer to Plain Bob Minor, with the 6 as observation bell (as in the image), unless otherwise stated.\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } If I make a call at In (I), the tenor will run out at the lead end.\nTrue\nFalse\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } If I make a call at Wrong (W), the tenor will be in 6ths place after the dodge.\nTrue\nFalse\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } If I make a call at Fourths (F), the tenor will make the bob.\nTrue\nFalse\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } How many calling positions are there in Plain Bob Minor?\n4\n5\n6\n  function changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } How many calling positions are there in Plain Bob Doubles?\n4\n5\n6\n \nCompose This #  Last section, we learned a simple composition of Plain Bob Doubles that consisted of just two bobs, right next to each other. Bearing in mind that the calling positions for Plain Bob Doubles are In, Out, Make, Home, can you translate that touch into notation that uses calling positions? Remember that most compositions assume that the heaviest working bell, here the 5, is the “observation bell” to which the calls pertain. (Hint, if you get stuck: Try writing out all the changes in the touch. Note what the 5 does at each lead. What would those calling positions be called?)\nConsider This #  Last section, we learned a simple lead-by-lead notation for calls. This time, we learned about calling positions (and next time, we’ll talk more about notation for compositions using calling positions). What are some pros and cons of using lead-by-lead notation instead of named calling positions? Which would you rather use to learn a very short touch? Which would you rather use to learn a quarter peal?\nNotes #    This is mostly true. It is not always true for Stedman or Erin, but is true for the vast majority of commonly rung methods (and some principles); the work of the observation bell directly relates to the name of the calling position. Grandsire, Stedman, and Erin have a language of their own which I won\u0026rsquo;t be covering here! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n If it helps to hear it another way: the calling position is not named by where the observation bell is when the call is made; it\u0026rsquo;s named by where the observation bell is when the call has been executed, which is a whole pull later! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There is another call known as \u0026ldquo;Middle\u0026rdquo; that we won\u0026rsquo;t cover in this section, but it can also be abbreviated with M. Often when there is a Middle (M) calling position available, the calling position used for making the fourths will be simply Fourths (F). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n It came up in the process of compiling this section that in fact, the two calling positions “Wrong and Home” used to be known as “Wrong and Right”. Conducting is definitely a living tradition and it has changed over time; clearly nothing here is set in stone! But I am setting down what I believe to be common practice these days. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Technically, there’s also “Home” for when long fifths are made, but this is more often just thought of as being unaffected! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/supplemental_skills/4_getting_practice/','title':"Getting Practice",'section':"Supplemental Skills",'content':"Getting Practice #  A lot of this chapter on Supplemental Skills has been devoted to the growth and development of the band through the actions of the caller or conductor; that is, watching out for getting the right type of touch, placing your band just so, and giving guidance in a kind and sensitive manner while also being effective.\nThis section, on \u0026ldquo;Getting Practice,\u0026rdquo; is about how to effectively advocate for yourself in getting the sorts of practice you will need to become a good conductor. Some people will not struggle with this problem at all; if anything, they will struggle with the opposite problem of over-confidence leading to a lot of very ambitious attempts, very few of which come round! But here we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the opposite side of the spectrum: perhaps you feel very shy about asking for opportunities, or your local tower leadership are not willing to let you have a go. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk over some different strategies you can use to get practice, regardless of your situation, by focusing on a few potential problems and some solutions to them.\nProblem: I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to practice. #  I think this is very common! \u0026ldquo;Learning to learn\u0026rdquo; is its own process and can often be quite difficult. How many people did you know in high school or college (sixth form or uni\u0026hellip;) who stared at their notes for hours and hours on end only to do poorly on exams? For many people, \u0026ldquo;note-staring\u0026rdquo; is not an effective form of study. Many people need to re-write out their notes, condense, highlight, color, draw, speak it out loud to someone, or teach someone else to have information truly sink in. Similarly, blankly staring at a composition is not an effective form of practice for most people trying to learn how to conduct. Everyone has a different learning style and thinks about ringing in a slightly different way, and so what works for one person may not work for the next. Here is a collection of a few different ways to practice; maybe one of them will work for you:\nStrategy 1: \u0026ldquo;Study\u0026rdquo; in advance #  Yes, this is the staring-at-the-composition bit. But don\u0026rsquo;t just stare: Maybe you need to write out the coursing orders, or write out the place bell order of the observation bell, or explain to a rubber duck on your desk how the part ends work. Maybe you need to figure out how to \u0026ldquo;chunk it up\u0026rdquo; in your head; is there a set of 3 Homes? Or a long run of calls at Before?\nSome people learn compositions (and methods) by learning a string of English words to repeat in their head as they ring. So for example, if they are calling \u0026ldquo;Wrong, 3 Befores, Middle, and Home\u0026rdquo; they will repeat that themselves (silently) and then think something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m at the Middle.\u0026rdquo;\nOthers learn very visually; still others only keep the coursing orders in mind and transpose them as the ringing goes on. Try a bunch of things and see what works for you. Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if you end up spending as much time learning the composition (in this very intense way) as you would just ringing it through, especially at first.\nStrategy 2: Try it out and reflect #  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve studied in advance, give it a go with a band (or with a virtual helper program, like a simulator or online program). Afterwards, take the time to sit down and reflect on what went well and what didn\u0026rsquo;t. Did you totally lose track of the composition? How can you help yourself fix that next time? Did the ringing fall apart through no fault of your own? Was there something you could\u0026rsquo;ve known but didn\u0026rsquo;t (like a useful coursing order) that would\u0026rsquo;ve helped?\nThink about which problems were specific to this composition with this band (\u0026ldquo;Well, it was a tricky cyclic composition and I put myself on the 3, which was a bad idea\u0026rdquo;) and which problems are more general (\u0026ldquo;I am putting some of my calls in slightly late\u0026rdquo;). Consider how to best fix those up next time. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know, try to ask other people what they do to get ideas. These can be local people or people on the internet; Facebook has several change ringing groups that can be useful resources for questions like these.\nStrategy 3: Ask for a shadow #  It\u0026rsquo;s very common when learning to ring to have someone watch with an eye to help, and learning to conduct is no exception. It is not uncommon for a learning conductor to ask for someone to \u0026ldquo;shadow\u0026rdquo; the composition. These shadow conductors watch the composition as closely as you will, and will step in if you go awry or get lost. They may even give a call if you miss one. I ask for this type of help sometimes even now, especially if I\u0026rsquo;m conducting something particularly tricky. I found I have only ever used my shadow conductor a few times; just knowing I have someone else watching the composition makes me feel more calm.\nWho to ask: Ask someone who is (a) friendly and (b) ideally, a better conductor than you are!\nWhat to ask: Ask them if they\u0026rsquo;d be willing to shadow you. Explain what the composition is and ask if they\u0026rsquo;d feel comfortable following the composition, but only jumping in if there is something you can\u0026rsquo;t set straight on your own (or if you miss a call, for example).\nWhen to ask: Ideally, enough in advance that the shadowing conductor can put some time in to study if they want. Except for certain very standard compositions, I would not be a very useful shadow if I were asked 5 minutes in advance! You may have access to a superstar conductor who would be fine, but it\u0026rsquo;s generally most polite to give some warning.\nAfter the ringing: First, thank them! Then, depending on your preference, you may want to follow-up with your shadow to ask if they saw anything that they\u0026rsquo;d like to give you advice on. For example, I once had a shadow conductor tell me that they were not at all worried about me putting the calls in the right lead because the whole lead before the call I was as stiff as a board with tension! We both laughed and I made sure to be mindful of how tense I was during the ringing from then on.\nProblem: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess up in front of others, or I don\u0026rsquo;t want to ask for a chance to try conducting. #  This problem is really tough! As one of the co-creators of Ringing Room, I see e-mails about this all the time from ringers \u0026mdash; you are certainly not alone if you feel this way. A common email might go like this:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d really love to use Ringing Room, but I\u0026rsquo;m so worried about messing up in front of my tower or wasting their time teaching me. Is there any solo practice mode on Ringing Room?\u0026quot;1\nI think a useful first approach is to think about why you feel this way. Is your local tower (or perhaps just one or two local ringers) prone to rudeness when something doesn\u0026rsquo;t go quite right, and have you had poor experiences with trying new things in front of them before? Or do you strongly dislike the feeling of being imperfect in front of others, even if they are perfectly friendly about it?\nIn the first case: I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry that your local tower has such an unfriendly culture. In my view, it should be absolutely unacceptable to be rude or mean to fellow ringers, but I do know it happens. Are there any other towers you can go to to get this practice? Or can you try to find a group online to practice with, if there are no in-person towers you can try? Maybe your local area has a handbell band with a slightly friendlier bent.\nIn the second case: It is very difficult to mess up in front of other people. It can feel vulnerable and isolating, especially if you are one of the only learners, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any close, supportive social bonds with the other ringers in your tower. If you can try practicing on your own time before bringing a touch to the bell tower, it may help you feel more confident when the time comes to practice with your local. As someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this particular problem, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I have other advice; but I can let you know that it is likely that your local band enjoy your company and want to see you succeed. They probably mess up frequently as well! I know I mess up sometimes too. It\u0026rsquo;s a sign of growth and change.\nProblem: My local leadership won\u0026rsquo;t let me have a go, or won\u0026rsquo;t let me try often enough. I\u0026rsquo;m \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; and not getting any better! #  You\u0026rsquo;ve asked and asked, but the tower captain won\u0026rsquo;t let you call anything! Or you get to call a touch once a month. This will definitely make progressing much more difficult. Maybe the tower captain is being unreasonable or maybe they\u0026rsquo;re not; in either case, you have to work with what you have.\nWell, I have a small secret for you that almost no one explicitly tells you when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn to call or conduct. At a certain point, you will almost certainly need to become responsible for your own conducting progress, and you will need to organize your own conducting opportunities. Unless you are a tower captain or otherwise in charge of a regular practice night, you are unlikely to get the frequency of opportunity you need to truly progress.\nWhat does it mean to organize your own opportunities? Well, it might take different forms. Maybe you form a handbell practice night and get your conducting practice in there. Maybe you book a tower for quarter peal attempts and invite 7 friends to come ring with you. In many of these cases, the organizer sets the band, including the conductor, and so you can choose yourself! This means you can get as much conducting experience as you\u0026rsquo;re willing to organize (and other people around you are willing to show up for!). By including virtual ringing opportunities, you could practically have conducting opportunities lined up every night.\nHaving to set up your own opportunities does require extra work. And, for some people, that\u0026rsquo;s particularly annoying because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like relevant work; it\u0026rsquo;s very social and involves inviting people and setting times and sending emails or making phone calls to local towers. However, the fact of the matter is that someone has to do that work, or there are no quarter peal attempts or peal attempts. It may as well be you, if you want to conduct them! Try to see it as a chance for growth. Plus, you get to know ringers in your local community better as you organize attempts or practice nights, which is often fulfilling in itself!\n This set of problems and ideas for solutions is not comprehensive, and not every idea will work for every person. Are you encountering other difficulties in your conducting progress? Or do you have other thoughts on how people might get better practice? Contact me and I may add them to this space.\nNotes #    These emails have decreased in frequency since Wheatley the Ringing Room bot was released, in collaboration with its developers. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/conducting/4_round_the_circle/','title':"Round The Circle",'section':"Conducting",'content':"Round The Circle #  In many resources about conducting, a particular emphasis is put on learning how to conduct from the tenor. This emphasis arises from a combination of long-held tradition and compositional convenience, but conducting from the tenor is not your only choice! This section of Calling It Round will spotlight different places in the circle from which it is possible to conduct.\nConducting from: the observation bell #  In many compositions, the observation bell is the heaviest working bell, and all of the calling positions are portrayed relative to its path through the blueline. It is common to conduct from the observation bell, especially as a beginning conductor.\n  Sometimes compositions will be written out explicitly for other observation bells, but in my experience this is fairly rare. Often when the tenor is not intended to be the observation bell, no calling positions are given at all, and instead calls are shown at the lead number as in this composition, shown to the right. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to pick your own observation bell \u0026mdash; or bells! A helpful strategy is to look at the part end1 and see if any of the bells end up in their \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; position at the part end, because then you know their work repeats in each part.\nHere, you can see that only the 5 ends up in the home position at the part end, which is 342576. So, the 5 might end up being a wise choice for observation bell because it will do the same thing in all six parts. By contrast, the 7 (perhaps a more traditional choice of observation bell for a triples composition), swaps places with the 6 every other part. Still possible to memorize, but certainly harder work.\n  To make matters harder, often you have to puzzle the observation bell out for yourself. Or, it might change from part to part, such as in this composition shown to the left, where (depending on preference) it might make sense to use the 6 or the 8 for observation at different times. Note how the 7-8 pair and the 5-6 pair are \u0026ldquo;swapped around\u0026rdquo; at the part end! Ringing the first part with both 6 and 8 as observation, you can think to yourself: \u0026ldquo;Before for the 8, Before for the 6, then five Homes for the 6\u0026rdquo; (remembering that the 3rd Home is a single, not a bob). Then the second part is \u0026ldquo;Before for the 6, Before for the 8, then five Homes for the 8\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s very structured in ways that might not be obvious from the ink on the page, and quite a pleasure to ring (very musical too!).\nAnother option for this composition is to use the 2 as observation, since it does return to its home position at the part end. However, it requires you to use many more calling positions than just Before and Home for different bells! Different folks will find different strategies easier or harder. In some compositions, no bells return to their \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; position at the part end, and the problem of choosing the observation bell can be particularly evident.\nConducting from: the cover #  Conducting from the cover is not particularly often done,2 but I think it has a place in this section. There are all sorts of reasons to enjoy conducting from the cover, including in the early stages of learning calling and then again in the early stages of picking up coursing orders. It might also be preferable if the other members of the band really want to ring inside, for example. It is also marvelous practice for watching another bell be observation bell, rather than ringing the observation bell, which is a useful skill for the reasons outlined above.\nConducting from: the treble #  The treble is another great place from which to start learning to conduct. It\u0026rsquo;s often a great place from which to watch coursing orders, especially since you might not need to have as many brain cells concentrated on ringing the method. Similarly to the cover, you also get rope-sight practice watching the observation bell, but with the added challenge of ringing a bell that moves through the method a little more. Bonus: you always know when the lead end and half lead are.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that eventually, conducting from the treble may feel harder than conducting from inside, especially on large numbers of bells. But lots of people do at least a little bit of conducting from the treble, and it can be great fun and good practice.\nConducting from: a \u0026ldquo;non-observation\u0026rdquo; bell #  While compositions are often written out with an observation bell in mind, sometimes (for whatever reason), you may prefer to ring with another bell as observation. For example, at my home tower the tenor is quite heavy and I\u0026rsquo;m not yet very good at ringing it cleanly. It\u0026rsquo;s a skill I\u0026rsquo;d like to build but it\u0026rsquo;s not there yet! So while I\u0026rsquo;ll conduct from the tenors in hand, I prefer not to conduct from the tenor in tower, generally. Therefore, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a variety of strategies to avoid it!\nI\u0026rsquo;m ordering the strategies roughly by what I perceive the relative difficulty to be, but others may find different things easier or harder.\nStrategy 1: Watch the observation bell from elsewhere #  This strategy requires some ropesight and maybe some advanced preparation, but is generally fairly accessible. It is the same strategy you can practice while ringing the cover or the treble, but this time you will be ringing an inside bell while watching another inside bell as observation. It can sometimes be beneficial to figure out good \u0026ldquo;landmarks\u0026rdquo; for watching the observation bell during this time that will give you a bit of warning. This may require some pen-and-paper work figuring out what the tenor does at various lead ends or half leads, for example. If you don\u0026rsquo;t notice that the tenor is dodging the treble at the front until it\u0026rsquo;s happening, you\u0026rsquo;re already too late to call the Before!\nStrategy 2: Take a lighter fixed bell #    The strategy of taking a lighter fixed bell is sometimes easier said than done, depending on what bell or bells you consider light. For example, this 1344 of Plain Bob Major does not have a fixed 2, 3, or 4! So you either have to ring a heavier bell, take on a greater memorization burden, or use one of the other strategies on this list. But let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re wanting to ring the 6 at our 8-bell tower to this 1250 of Cambridge Surprise Major shown to the right.\nYou can see that there are only calls at Wrong and Home for the tenor, and that the 6 comes back to its home position at the end of every course. Since the 6 is therefore a fixed bell in this composition, it seems a good target for this strategy. The idea is to translate the composition from being tenor-based to being 6-based, so you can ring and use your own bell as observation, even though the composition was not originally notated that way. Using your own knowledge of Cambridge or using the blueline feature on CompLib, you can see that \u0026ldquo;Wrong\u0026rdquo; for the 8 is \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; for the 6. (Phrased another way: when the 8 is dodging 7-8 up, the 6 is dodging 7-8 down).\n  Whereas \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; for the 8 is \u0026ldquo;Middle\u0026rdquo; for the 6. (Phrased another way: When the 8 is dodging 7-8 up, the 6 is dodging 5-6 down.)\n  So for the 8, you could say the composition: \u0026ldquo;Wrong, Home, 3 Wrongs, 2 Homes, single Wrong\u0026rdquo;. For the 6, the same composition could be said \u0026ldquo;Home, Middle, 3 Homes, 2 Middles, single Home\u0026rdquo;. The only difference is that you are watching your own bell (the 6) using the calling positions relative to the 6 after you\u0026rsquo;ve translated them from \u0026ldquo;tenor-speak\u0026rdquo;.\nThis strategy does generally require some pen-and-paper work (or mental figuring) before you begin, but it pays dividends in that you can generally figure out a way to ring the bell you want to ring and the composition you want to ring, even if they seem initially at odds. And you don\u0026rsquo;t have to watch anyone else\u0026rsquo;s bell to figure out where to put the calls in (obviously you will want to watch to see if it\u0026rsquo;s going well!).\nStrategy 3: Rotate the composition #  This strategy requires perhaps the most pen-and-paper work, but can be fun and a good exercise. I will cover only the general idea here.\nRecall the touch of Plain Bob Minor that goes ppb ppb. We saw this touch in an earlier chapter of Calling It Round. It turns out that you can also call a very related touch: pbp pbp. And another: bpp bpp. These touches are so related to one another that many ringers would call them rotations of a single touch. To understand a little more about why, it\u0026rsquo;s useful once more to shed our limited linear writing system and look at a circle:\n Around the circle are all the plains and bobs in this touch. In ppb ppb you start at the top:\n But you can also start in the middle:\n Or anywhere else:\n It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where on the circle you start \u0026mdash; plain or bob, top or bottom, whatever \u0026mdash; the idea is that ringing a bob and two plains around the circle like this will always get you back where you started.\nThis feature of compositions extends to more complex compositions. Often when you rotate a composition, different bells become more or less reasonable to use as observation bells.\n  I will show one example of rotation of a slightly more complex rotation. Here\u0026rsquo;s a 1344 of Cambridge Surprise Major. Note that the definition of a single is not 1234 (so probably best to warn your band before ringing!). The composition has you ringing a single at Home (for the tenor) every course for 6 courses in total.\nWriting this out by-the-lead, we know that Cambridge has 7 leads per course and we get: pppppps pppppps pppppps pppppps pppppps pppppps. Or more succinctly: pppppps, 6 part. Just like with the short composition of Plain Bob Minor above, you can rotate the singles to happen anywhere in the composition. Let\u0026rsquo;s try looking at what would happen if you put the single somewhere in the middle: pppsppp, 6 part. You get the following rotation (the \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo; at the top just means the 4th lead in the course gets the single).\n Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look. Before, the 7 and 8 were fixed (we know this because the 7 and 8 were omitted from the part ends). Now, different bells are fixed. One fixed bell is still the 8; you can tell because it\u0026rsquo;s at the end of every course head, in its home position. What is the other fixed bell?\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise  Fixed bell Submit    You can rotate it several different ways to find a rotation that works for you and has a fixed bell you like.\nWarnings:\n While this strategy will never lead to falseness (if the original composition is true), it may drastically change other aspects of the composition, such as musicality. Beware! If you are using software to rotate compositions rather than working them out yourself, be careful that it is doing what you want. For example, in CompLib if you ask it to put the single in the 3rd lead in every part, it will happily do so; however, the single affects the tenor which causes the course to be lengthened. So the next single comes in the 3rd lead of the next course, but does not come exactly 7 leads after the first, which violates the rotation rules and, in this case, leads to falseness. You cannot use this strategy to get arbitrary fixed bells. There is a simple mathematical proof of this fact. There are 21 different pairs of working bells (7 choose 2). There are 7 different rotations, so you can at most see only 7 of those pairs fixed. So for any given composition, you may not be able to get the 2 fixed, or the 3 and 4 fixed, for example.  Strategy 4: Coursing orders #  This strategy is, to my estimation, more involved than the above options. It requires you to be able to figure out a way to watch the coursing order from your bell, wherever it may be, and then figure out how you want to change the coursing order and then make that call at the appropriate time. I think this is somewhat beyond the scope of this section, but I wanted to make you aware that this is an option and many of the best conductors I know use it to conduct from anywhere in the circle.\nConducting from: a handbell pair #  If you\u0026rsquo;re particularly interested in conducting for handbells, I recommend reading the Supplemental Skills section on Conducting in Hand.\nNotes #    Yes, technically, the part head. :) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I checked BellBoard for the number of times a tower bell performance of Triples had been rung with the conductor on the cover. There were over 300 performances; so while not common, it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly rare either and generally several quarters or peals are rung this way each year. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/conducting/5_bringing_it_round/','title':"Bringing It Round",'section':"Conducting",'content':"Bringing It Round #  We\u0026rsquo;ve been through a lot of material together! This last section is just for compositions to get you good practice at \u0026ldquo;bringing it round,\u0026rdquo; so to speak.\nComposition collections #  The skills and techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve learned can be applied to nearly any composition, including those from the chapter on Calling. However, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes useful to have access to a small list of compositions to choose from which are uniquely suited to one\u0026rsquo;s needs. With that in mind, I\u0026rsquo;ve compiled a few compositions for you. There are two CompLib collections which I think you might enjoy:\n Calling It Round: Good quarters for practice is a collection that has 13 quarter compositions for Major methods. Mix and Match: Simple Quarter Peals of Minor is a collection that does what it says on the tin! It has several 720s (extents of minor) and a few bits less than that to add up to make a quarter.  Both of these collections tend towards simple, commonly-rung quarter peals. Many have a very limited set of calling positions, and where possible only 3- or 4-bell coursing orders to keep track of.\nOther resources #  If you are interested in finding other compositions with which to practice, I can recommend the following online resources:\n Composition Library, run by Graham John, has an extensive collection and a good search engine. ringing.org, run by Don Morrison, also has an extensive (though perhaps slightly more curated) collection all very well-organized under different headings and easy to browse through.  I almost always check both places when looking for a composition.\nAs far as print resources, there are many good ones.\n A favorite of mine is The Ringing World Diary, published each year by The Ringing World with a very carefully curated selection of good touches, quarter peals, and peals. It can be purchased here. There are also a variety of compilations by John Longridge, such as Composition 500 (for peals), Quarter 500 (for quarters), and Standard 90, which contains touches, quarter peals, and peals alike. John Longridge\u0026rsquo;s books can be purchased through the support website for his books. There are also many collections available through the Whiting Society but I have not personally read any of the books in this collection.  The print resources, especially the older ones, may follow slightly different conventions than I have in Calling It Round; but variety is the spice of life and now it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to figure out what you like best! There are also many other wonderful sources of compositions both on the internet and in print.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/supplemental_skills/5_conducting_in_hand/','title':"Conducting in Hand",'section':"Supplemental Skills",'content':"Conducting in Hand #  Much of the information in Calling It Round applies equally well to tower bell ringers and handbell ringers. However, there are some special tricks that are mostly suitable for handbell ringers that I think will be useful for you as you make a start at calling and conducting. Some of these tips may not be useful right away, and this will likely vary ringer to ringer; so take what\u0026rsquo;s useful and leave the rest!\nUse both your bells #  If you’re going to be ringing two bells while calling, they might as well both be useful to you. When you are starting, you are likely starting to call from either the trebles or the tenors. When you are ringing the trebles, you have the advantage of always knowing where the treble is (and therefore where to make the call!) somewhat “automatically,” which can be a huge advantage at first. Choosing compositions that can use the 2 as observation, then, will make your life quite a bit easier because you’ll be using “both your bells” and don’t have to necessarily rely on another ringer or another bell to keep yourself straight within the composition.\nIf you are ringing the tenors, you can also use both your bells. Even though the tenor is likely the observation bell, check in advance to see if there are any landmarks you can use with your other bell. For example, in the common touch WsWWsW for Plain Bob Minor (said: \u0026ldquo;Wrong, single Wrong, Wrong, single Wrong\u0026rdquo;), at each single it is the 5 making 3rds while the tenor dodges Wrong. In fact, in that touch, the 5-6 pair has a pattern that repeats! This touch can also easily be lengthened into a quarter that has these nice qualities for the 5-6. The 720 is given by WsWWsWHx3, and then either that can be repeated or a shorter second part (a 540) can be rung with WsWWsWHx2 followed by a final Home. This CompLib collection has both of those options included as well as others.\nPick handbell-friendly compositions #  There are a variety of compositions that are particularly composed for handbells. These have nice properties like leaving pairs of bells coursing, or having pairs of bells swapped over at part ends, or things like that. Even if you don’t know exactly what makes a composition “handbell-friendly,” using compositions that are marked that way is likely to be easier for your band and therefore less likely to cause a trip-up.\nUsing search #  Don Morrison\u0026rsquo;s website ringing.org has particularly good resources for handbell callers and conductors. Visit the relevant page and look for “handbells” within that page; many compositions are specially marked as being particularly suitable for handbells. As you study compositions of that type you should get an intuitive feel for some of the things that make a composition good for handbell ringers.\nUsing CompLib\u0026rsquo;s Handbell Positions #  There are a few other ways to figure out whether a composition is particularly handbell friendly which involve the use of CompLib\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Handbell Positions\u0026rdquo; tab under a given composition. For example, have a look at two different quarter peal compositions for Plain Bob Major.\n  This 1264 has a limited number of calling positions and leaves the tenors unaffected. So far, so good; and it\u0026rsquo;s fairly musical as well with a music score of 212. Let\u0026rsquo;s look more in depth at the handbell pairs, though. By reading across each row of the table, you can see the amount of the time that each pair is ringing its own pattern. So for example, the 1-2 pair will always be ringing leads from the 1-2 pattern, because the treble has a fixed line in each lead. In this composition, the 3-4 and 5-6 pairs spend a good amount of time in their own pattern, but also spend a fair amount of time in the other two available patterns.\nCompare that to this 1264 of Plain Bob Major, which is arguably slightly less musical with the music score of 203 and which has fewer calls at Home.1\n  However, 3-4 pair spends no time in the 5-6 pattern, and is only ever in its home pattern or in the 7-8 pattern. This is great: the ringer of the 3-4 pair will likely have practiced the 3-4 pair to plain courses and that will feel familiar. The 7-8 pattern is special because the 7-8 are often coursing, and are therefore often an \u0026ldquo;easier\u0026rdquo; pair to learn. Avoiding the 3-4 ringing the 5-6 pattern makes it an easier composition for a handbell band. Similarly, the 5-6 pair does not have to ring too many leads in the 3-4 pattern and spends the majority of its time at home or in the 7-8 pattern.\nSo these two compositions, which have many similar features \u0026mdash; both are nice quarter peals of Plain Bob, relatively similarly musical and with only a few calling positions each \u0026mdash; will feel quite different to one another for a handbell band.\nUsing lead heads #  You can also look at these features without using CompLib, by simply looking at the lead heads throughout the composition, but this is certainly more error-prone much more time-consuming! However, one area that\u0026rsquo;s useful to look at for any composition is the part ends of a multi-part composition.\n  For example, take a look at this composition of Robert T Kakuk\u0026rsquo;s on ringing.org (noting that someone has already helpfully annotated it as \u0026ldquo;For handbells\u0026rdquo;!). The composition repeats itself, and the part end is 24365. Recall that this is short for the row 12436578; that is, rounds with the 3-4 and 5-6 swapped over. This part end means that in the second part, each person in the band will repeat the exact same work they just did, but the ringers of the 3-4 and 5-6 pairs will simply be crossed over. This type of structure will make it much easier for your ringers to stay right or for you to put it right if required. If you\u0026rsquo;re learning the course ends or the coursing orders, only half as much learning is required as you can simply remember that the 3-4 and 5-6 are swapped over in the second half.\nOther resources #  I highly recommend the book Change-Ringing on Handbells (Volume 1: Basic Techniques) by Tina Stoecklin and Simon Gay. They have many tips and tricks and go into much more detail than I have here.\nNotes #    Music scores reflect a certain musical preference (you can see what is judged by clicking on the Music Score tab) but the scores are by no means objective arbiters of taste! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/calling/4_learning_short_touches/','title':"Learning Short Touches",'section':"Calling",'content':"Learning Short Touches #  In this section, we’ll put together everything we’ve covered over the course of Calling It Round so far by learning 2 different short touches that use the most common calling positions. In addition, I’ve compiled some collections of other short touches that use these calling positions as well; these collections will be included at the bottom as resources.\nWrong Home, Wrong Home #    The first touch we’ll go over is a great one for practice night; simple, with relatively few calls, and short enough for a second attempt if the first goes awry. When ringers talk about this touch, they will often call it “Wrong Home, Wrong Home” or, more rarely, “Wrong Home, repeat”. You can see on left-hand side that using calling positions here instead of calling it “bpppbbpppb” saves us a lot of space and a lot of remembering; we can just write out “WH WH” (or “WHx2”) instead and be done with it!\nA few words about how this composition is laid out: On the right-hand side, you can see a bunch of rows with the treble at the start and the other bells in different orders each time. The long horizontal lines split the rows into two courses, each of which ends with the tenor returning to its home position of 6ths place.\nThese rows themselves are the lead heads. To be explicit: These are the rows that are the backstroke lead of the treble. The left-hand side of the image shows whether there is a call or not, and at which calling position it is called. So you can see there is a bob at Wrong, a bob at Home, and then another bob at Wrong and another bob at Home. The hyphen \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; indicates that it is a bob, and the W or H indicates Wrong or Home. After the last home is called, the backstroke row will be 123456 \u0026mdash; rounds!\nIt is easiest to call this touch from the tenor, though it can be called from other bells. If you’re calling it from the tenor, then you can simply make a call every time you would be unaffected by that call; you make a call every time you dodge in 5-6, whether up or down. If you would like to know more about calling this touch from a lighter bell, there will be sections elsewhere on the Calling It Round site that discuss that; there are also a variety of resources in The Ringing World which I will link below. In brief: One option is to call the touch from a different bell but watch the tenor to figure out where to put the calls; another is to call whenever you dodge in 5-6 (up or down), regardless of the bell you’re ringing. It’s particularly musical from the 3 or 4, but perfectly acceptable to ring from any working bell.1 I recommend trying to call this touch from a variety of bells and seeing what you like to do best. Is it easier to see how the bells go if you call from one place or another? Do you prefer when there’s a call the first lead and the last lead, or if the calls are all towards the middle (as happens when you call from the 2 or 3)?\nTwo things to be careful of when you’re trying this touch for the first time, assuming you’re ringing the composition as laid out above:\n The first call (a bob at Wrong) is right after the first lead, so be on your toes! The second Wrong comes the lead straight after the first call at Home. So even though those two calls are in different courses, they feel awfully close together! I always recommend that when you’re first starting out, you look at the composition lead-by-lead to get a sense of where calls come in clusters. You might not necessarily have enough time to puzzle out that the Wrong is next in the heat of the moment; you might have to rely on your memory that the two calls come side-by-side.2  Three Homes #    The next (and final!) touch for this section is often called “Three Homes”. And it is what it says on the tin! See the left-hand side image for the composition. You can see there are three courses, with a call at Home in every course.\nIn Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” gets you to 120 rows. That’s an extent! So you can link together 11 extents just like this one for a slightly repetitive but perfectly legitimate quarter peal of Plain Bob Doubles.3 It would be very good practice for “Three Homes,” that’s for sure.\nJust like “Wrong Home, Wrong Home”, Three Homes works for any bell. You can grab the 3 and call “bob” every time the 3 makes long fifths and you will ring a perfectly good extent! In fact, this feature \u0026ndash; that you can call Three Homes from any bell \u0026ndash; is one that is often used to make counting extents slightly less taxing. Once you’ve gotten a good amount of practice calling yourself as observation, you can begin to call extents while ringing your own bell and watching other bells to figure out where to put the calls in. If you call Three Homes for the 2, then the 3, then the 4, then the 5, you’ve called four extents. Repeat to get 8 extents, and then get the remaining 3 extents however you please; no counting to 11 required.\nYou can use “Three Homes” not only from different observation bells, but also for different methods entirely. Though the composition above uses Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” is actually a composition that works in a great variety of methods. Bear in mind that “Home” can mean something slightly different for other methods \u0026mdash; in Plain Bob Doubles, it means make long 5ths, but in Plain Bob Minor it means dodge 5-6 down! You can also use “Three Homes” with a huge variety of methods, like Kent Treble Bob Minor or Bristol Surprise Major, though you should also be aware that the Home may come in different places in the plain course in different methods. For these other methods, too, you can call from any bell; just be aware that there could be musical or other consequences! Whether you mind that or not is up to you. Word to the wise: while this is an extremely versatile composition, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work everywhere (notably, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for Grandsire), so be sure you know what you\u0026rsquo;re in for before you start.\n Both of the above touches and more are included at this link:\n Short \u0026amp; Sweet: Touches of Plain Bob Collection  This collection was compiled for those working their way through Calling It Round. Once you’re there, you’ll find a list of compositions. You can click on any of the compositions to learn more. The collection is hosted on CompLib, which is a site built and maintained by Graham John. It\u0026rsquo;s an excellent resource, and if you are interested in learning more about calling and conducting, I strongly recommend availing yourself of it. It is well worth the time spent playing with all of the settings and figuring out what is most useful. For a starting caller, it is often very useful to click the composition and then the “Blue Line” section of the composition, so you can get a good sense of what all the bells do through the composition (and maybe remind yourself of where the calling positions come!)\nExercises #  Click this #  I really recommend creating an account and exploring around complib.org. Another resource I use very frequently is ringing.org, an excellent curated collection compiled and maintained by Don Morrison. I find that ringing.org is easier to navigate and has a more curated collection, whereas complib.org has more (and more complex) features but less curation. I use both frequently, though often for different things. For handbell ringers, I particularly recommend Don Morrison’s site as it frequently annotates which compositions are particularly suitable for handbells. You can simply navigate to a page of compositions and ctrl+F for “handbells” to see what I mean.\nRead This #  Want to know more about calling from a lighter bell?

However, to unlock the rest of the huge treasure trove of compositions that exist, it’s necessary to know just a few more things. In this section, we’ll cover:\n A few more common calling positions (enough to get you through a majority of commonly-called compositions) A common touch, used for practices or Sunday services, that uses some of these new calling positions as well as some familiar ones. A few resources you can use to teach yourself more calling positions, when it becomes relevant.  A few more calling positions #  In the first section where we talked about calling positions, we discussed the calling positions of Plain Bob Minor. Today, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about two more calling positions which don\u0026rsquo;t exist in Plain Bob Minor, but do exist for Plain Bob Major and the majority of other methods on 8 or more bells.1\n  Brief review #  From Demystifying \u0026lsquo;In, Out, Make\u0026rsquo;, you should remember the Wrong (W) calling position, which comes after the first lead in Plain Bob. You can see it marked above as \u0026ldquo;-W,\u0026rdquo; right at the row where the call Wrong would be made. The Home (H) calling position comes after the last lead in the plain course, when the tenor is about to come to its home position (here, 8ths place) at the lead end. Note that Wrong and Home are farther apart from each other in Major compared to Minor because the calling positions are relative to the position of the observation bell (most often the tenor) rather than being, say, a certain number of leads in.\nIn between \u0026ldquo;-W\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;-H\u0026rdquo; there are several new symbols, laid out in the table below:\n   Calling Position Abbr Definition (with tenor as observation bell)     Fifths V This calling position uses the Roman numeral for 5 to show that it is where the observation bell becomes 5ths place bell at the lead end. It is not very commonly used.   Fourths F This calling position marks where the observation bell would make fourths during the call (whether bob or single).   Before B At a Before, the observation bell is coursing before the treble and ends up either running out at a bob or making seconds during the single.   In I At an In, the observation bell will run in during a bob. Note that if there is to be a single called at this place in the blue line, this calling position is sometimes called Thirds (T).   Middle M Beware, this is M for Middle and not M for Make! More on this calling position below.    Extra considerations #  More about Middle\nMiddle is an extremely commonly used calling position, but it is a little trickier than some of the others. The name is not obvious unlike \u0026ldquo;In\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Fourths,\u0026rdquo; yet it\u0026rsquo;s used in a huge variety of compositions. For even stage methods, like 8 or 10 or 12, Middle most often refers to the time when the observation bell becomes the place bell two less than the number of bells ringing. So, if Major is being rung, the Middle is called when the observation bell becomes 6ths place bell. If Royal is being rung, the Middle is called when the observation bell becomes 8ths place bell, and so on; just subtract two from the stage.\nFor odd stage methods, the definition of Middle can be confusing or inconsistent, so it\u0026rsquo;s very important to make sure that you are aware of what the composer intended.\nWhich of these calling positions are the \u0026ldquo;most important\u0026rdquo; and why?\nIn the table above, only Fifths, Fourths, and Middle are technically \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo;. Before and In were covered in the previous section on calling positions. If you are only going to learn one of the new calling positions at a time, Middle is the one to focus on first.\nWhy? It\u0026rsquo;s used in a huge variety of compositions. In my experience, knowledge of only Home, Wrong, and Middle will allow one access to a huge array of touches, quarters, and even peals. Okay, I hear you ask, but why those three?\nTo answer this question requires a bit of a tangent, so feel free to skip this bit if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interest and go straight to the practice touch. Here are some reasons that Home, Wrong, and Middle are some of the most common calling positions. I\u0026rsquo;ll use the traditional notion of the tenor as observation bell to explain some of the reasoning, much of which is either historical or musical:\n Wrong, Middle, and Home (in methods where the lead end has a bell making seconds) are often situated in the course such that the observation bell (again, traditionally the tenor) will be unaffected by the call. That means that the observation bell keeps doing what it\u0026rsquo;s doing and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be involved in making the call. The tenor being unaffected is also desirable because the call therefore maintains the natural length of the course. If the tenor has to run in or make fourths or what have you, it veers off its normal path and the course may become longer or shorter (depending on the exact call and method). Recall that a course is commonly defined as the time between when the tenor is at its home position and when it returns there. You may note that there is one other calling position in Major which leaves the tenor unaffected; that is Fifths (V). The Fifths calling position, in contrast, is much less commonly used. Why? This has to do with some of the musical qualities guaranteed by using Wrong, Middle, and Home. Wrong, Middle, and Home happen at places in the Plain Bob Major blue line that don\u0026rsquo;t affect the tenor (the 8), but unlike Fifths, they also don\u0026rsquo;t affect the 7. Leaving the 7 unaffected is nice for stability (since ringers are so used to it), but it\u0026rsquo;s not a guarantee or a necessity. There is also a large element of tradition. A lot of work and time has been spent figuring out compositional structures involving Wrong, Middle, and Home, and they are building blocks used by many, if not most, composers. Ringers, conductors, and composers alike are used to many commmonly-rung compositions being \u0026ldquo;tenors together,\u0026rdquo; which refers to a composition where the tenors are always coursing each other. Even if you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of \u0026ldquo;tenors together,\u0026rdquo; if you\u0026rsquo;re musically sensitive it\u0026rsquo;s quite possible that the music of a touch with \u0026ldquo;split tenors\u0026rdquo; would sound strange to you. Many subconscious assumptions about how a piece of ringing \u0026ldquo;should\u0026rdquo; sound, when violated, can lead to confusion and disarray even in otherwise strong bands, and so there is a tendency towards having most compositions remain tenors together.  A practice touch #  This practice touch will have you using some calling positions that should be familiar and some new calling positions. And no rest for the weary; I\u0026rsquo;ll be showing you the composition in yet another type of notation. Calling and conducting resources use a huge variety of (sometimes extremely) condensed notation. Much of it is fairly standardized by this time, but it\u0026rsquo;s my aim to show you a smattering of the types of notation you might see out \u0026ldquo;in the wild\u0026rdquo; when trying to find your own compositions. This next notation is most frequently used for shorter touches (less than quarter peal length), is extremely condensed, and relies on your new skills in remembering calling position abbreviations. Ready? Here\u0026rsquo;s the touch:\nW3BMH\nA common way to say this aloud is \u0026ldquo;Wrong, Three Befores, Middle, and Home\u0026rdquo;. Note that the 3 refers to the number of calls at Before \u0026mdash; and not to anything else.\nDifferent people will have different impulses when they are given a composition in this form. Some are very confident and feel ready to grab hold and try it right away. Some feel intimidated by the number of different calling positions and may be timid to try, especially if many of the calling positions are new. If you\u0026rsquo;re closer to the feeling-intimidated side, or even if you\u0026rsquo;re not, here are some tips that you can use whenever you see a new composition and you want to figure out how to crack it. Compositions are a little bit like mini-puzzles (which is, I suspect, why there is a high overlap between composers and puzzle-lovers) and it takes everyone a different amount of time to figure out how they best like to solve them. Here are some strategies that have worked for me; maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll work for you.\nStrategy 1: Write It Out #    Maybe in the modern age this is a bit old-fashioned. After all, what are iPads for? But I think when you\u0026rsquo;re first starting, writing out and taking the time to go slowly through the touch and understand where all the calls are can be very useful indeed. Write out as much or as little as you need. You may start by writing out every single row, from rounds back to rounds! Or you may only need to write out lead heads, or another helpful schematic. But if you can\u0026rsquo;t figure out where to get started on a composition, writing it out is always a great starting place. Make sure you clearly understand where the calls go in and what they do to the bells; both your bell(s) and everyone else\u0026rsquo;s.\nStrategy 2: Look It Up #  Graham John\u0026rsquo;s Composition Library is a huge boon for ringers everywhere, and it is an especially invaluable resource for the conductor (at any stage of their development!). If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a new composition you\u0026rsquo;d like to figure out, try finding it on complib (or, try inputting it yourself!). Here is a link to W3BMH. Click the gear button to adjust viewing settings. Do you like to view it by courses or by leads?\nOf particular use, I think, is the \u0026ldquo;Blue Line\u0026rdquo; section, which can be expanded by clicking on the words \u0026ldquo;Blue Line\u0026rdquo; in the CompLib page. There, you can see each of the rows in the touch, written out, with a marking by where the calls ought to go. Note that the calls are written next to the row of the treble\u0026rsquo;s handstroke lead, and are written on the left-hand side rather than the right as in the image of Plain Bob Major above; this is just down to different people preferring different conventions.\n  The blue line layout is very useful for this touch. It can warn you that the 3 calls at Before all line up right next to each other! Since the tenor runs out at each call, it repeats the lead it just rang and is ready to run out again at the very next lead end. The call at Middle is just before the call at Home, and the \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all!\u0026rdquo; comes just as the final bob is executed! So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot happening at once. But it\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful touch, very musical and reasonably short, and great practice for these four common calling positions.\nStrategy 3: Give It A Go #  Sometimes, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing for it but to give it a go. See if you can input the touch into your favorite ringing software and practice giving the calls in time. Or maybe you have a band all willing and waiting for you to call something new!\nResources for learning more #  You\u0026rsquo;ve learned most of the major (ha) calling positions! This is no minor (ha) feat. But of course, there are more calling positions than just those (especially if you include Grandsire and Stedman!); how is anybody supposed to keep track?\nIf you are needing to learn a new calling position, it\u0026rsquo;s likely because you have found or have been given a composition to learn that has a new-to-you calling position in it. Depending on how it is notated, it may or may not be obvious to see where the observation bell is in the lead head after the call is made. However, you have a few options for recourse: you can ask a band member or mentor, or you can look up the calling positions either in John Harrison\u0026rsquo;s Glossary or on Composition Library in the Help at the very bottom. Other resources may exist as well; please contact me if you\u0026rsquo;d like them linked here.\nExercises #  Answer this #  For the questions below, assume Plain Bob Major with the tenor as observation bell unless otherwise specified.\nfunction changeLabel(lab_id, new_text, correct) { let label = document.getElementById(lab_id); if (!label.style.color) { let old_text = label.innerText; label.innerText = old_text + \" — \" + new_text; console.log(typeof correct); if (correct) { label.style.color = \"blue\" } else { label.style.color = \"red\" } } } The tenor is dodging 5-6 down at the lead end (in other words: it will be 6ths place bell).

What does the tenor do?\nRun in\nRun out\nMake\n \nPractice this #  Try out the practice touch above. When you\u0026rsquo;re finished, reflect on what went well and what could\u0026rsquo;ve gone better. Sometimes it can be helpful to discuss with another band member or write it in a personal journal to keep track of areas for improvement. No one is perfect right away! The difference between progress and stagnation is looking for growth areas.\nFind this #  Find a touch, either online or in print, that uses Before or Middle. Try the three stragies: write it out, look it up, give it a go. What works best for you? What order do you prefer to try the strategies in? Do you have other strategies that work well for you?\nNotes #    Though, as before, the calling positions may mean slightly different things from method to method, or may come in a slightly different order! For example, in Kent Treble Bob Major, the Home comes after the first lead in the course. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/ebook-site/docs/calling/6_learning_quarter/','title':"Learning Quarter-Length Compositions (or Longer)",'section':"Calling",'content':"Learning Quarter-Length Compositions (or Longer) #  In this concluding section of the chapter on Calling, we\u0026rsquo;ll be covering learning quarter-length or longer compositions. I debated for a long time whether to put this section in the Calling chapter or the Conducting chapter, because once you are calling longer compositions it is frequently very helpful to begin checking the ringing (conducting); however, it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary and I know I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t checking the ringing when I called my first quarter peal.\nSo here we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about strategies that you can use to read and learn longer compositions, such as might be appropriate for a quarter-peal or a peal. Whether you\u0026rsquo;ve already called several quarters and a peal or whether you\u0026rsquo;ve just started calling touches at practice night, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely useful to know the strategies that you can use to understand and \u0026ldquo;chunk up\u0026rdquo; longer compositions to make them easier to remember. So, to start off this chapter, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss a couple of the ways that I personally find useful when thinking about reading and learning longer compositions. We\u0026rsquo;ll start with how to read long-form compositions, using the most common notation, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll cover strategies for learning them effectively for conducting purposes.\nThroughout, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the same quarter peal composition displayed in different formats. You may find one format easier than another, and this preference may change over the course of your journey as a caller or conductor. It may feel like the below is more of a Composition Library tutorial than a briefing on how to conduct; but the reality of the situation is that \u0026ldquo;in the wild\u0026rdquo; you will see compositions in a huge variety of notations and styles, and Composition Library is one of the best tools available to the modern ringer for seeing a given composition presented in many styles at the click of a button.\nHow to read and learn a composition (by leads) #    First we\u0026rsquo;ll review a familiar compositional layout, with a few new bits. This example on the left shows each lead of the first part a 720 of Plain Bob Minor. Since a 720 of Minor is an extent, ringing this composition twice would make a quarter peal. It would come round in the middle and the ringers would then keep going.\nYou can see the calls are in familiar places; only at Wrong and Home. Recall that \u0026ldquo;sH\u0026rdquo; means there is a single called at the last Home in the part. The two new pieces that we haven\u0026rsquo;t discussed before are the meaning of the phrase \u0026ldquo;6 part\u0026rdquo; and the brackets with note. The lead heads are all displayed on the right side of the composition (recall that the lead head is most often the backstroke row of the treble\u0026rsquo;s lead; so after any call has taken effect).\nIn this context, \u0026ldquo;6 part\u0026rdquo; means that you will call the basic block that you see on the page a total of 6 times. Note that this is the same as \u0026ldquo;Repeat 5 times\u0026rdquo; (since you have to have rung it once to start with and 1+5=6). Different sources will use different conventions, and it is important to be careful to know which one you are looking at or you might end up with an extra part or a missing part and a very confused band!\nThe brackets around the [sH] indicate that the single at Home is not to be called in every part. Instead, it is only to be called in some subset of the parts. In this composition, the single at Home is meant to be included in parts 3 and 6. This can sometimes be notated as \u0026ldquo;sH at half-way and end\u0026rdquo;, which is the same thing.\nUsing the \u0026ldquo;lead by lead\u0026rdquo; layout has a few advantages. For one thing, you can easily see at a glance who is involved in each of the calls. So for the second bob at Wrong, I can see that the 3 will make it and the 4 will run in. Note, though, that different bells can (and will!) do different work in the other parts.\nYou can also see that the Home in the first course is right next to the Wrong of the second course, which might be a useful reminder.\nHow to read and learn a composition (by courses) #    A more concise way to state the same composition is shown on the right. You can see that instead of showing every lead head on the right-hand side of the composition layout, only the course heads are shown. This cuts out a lot of information that you may want! However, some people may find this condensed format much easier to memorize, depending on personal memorization style.\nHere, the \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; stands for bob and the \u0026ldquo;s\u0026rdquo; stands for single as usual. The column headers \u0026ldquo;W\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;H\u0026rdquo; indicate the calling position. The brackets around \u0026ldquo;s\u0026rdquo; mean that the call isn\u0026rsquo;t included in all parts; the footnote further clarifies that one out to include it in parts 3 and 6. When you see brackets in a composition, make sure you know what they mean and how they affect the composition before ringing.\n  If the meaning of the bracketed single is still elusive, perhaps a look at the following view will help. This view also shows each course head (rather than each lead head), but it shows every part rather than just showing one part and telling you \u0026ldquo;6 part\u0026rdquo;. The heavy solid lines separate out the different parts and indeed there are six of them. With this layout, it may be easier for you to visualize where exactly where the singles go.\nMemorization tips #  If you\u0026rsquo;ve had musical training, perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve had to memorize a piece of music. The leap from reading from the sheet music \u0026mdash; with its orderly dots and lines \u0026mdash; to being able to recall complex passages from memory is, for many, a significant challenge. Even when starting very young, it can take years to build up the skills required to move from the passive intake of sheet music to the active, and ideally perfect, recalling from memory of a complex composition.\nRinging is no different. Traditionally, ringers haven\u0026rsquo;t used any form of visual aid for hundreds of years, and conductors haven\u0026rsquo;t either. That means that you have to effectively memorize something that may be very complex, and act on that information while pulling a rope or ringing two handbells. However, the ability to memorize compositions, even long ones, is a learnable skill! It just takes building up slowly.\nHere we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss some tips that you can use when you are first \u0026ldquo;learning to learn\u0026rdquo; compositions. Not everything works for everyone \u0026mdash; something that is extremely useful to one person might be ruinous to someone else \u0026mdash; but I hope by presenting a variety of techniques you might find one or two that are useful, or it might spark a brainstorm where you think of something new entirely!\nTip 1: Look for structure #  If I told you to memorize \u0026ldquo;bpppbbppppbpppbbppppbpppbbpppp\u0026rdquo; on its own, you would probably find it challenging unless you realized that there was a regular, repeating pattern of the bobs and singles, which can be revealed by spaces: \u0026ldquo;bpppb bpppp bpppb bpppp bpppb bpppp\u0026rdquo;.\nMost compositions have some sort of repeating structure that you can use. The above composition is a 3 part so it repeats itself twice; that\u0026rsquo;s one-third the learning for you! Choosing compositions with several parts when you\u0026rsquo;re starting out is an easy way to make the memorization a little easier. Of course, it is possible to go too far the other way and choose 12 or 15 part compositions where the danger is more on the side of forgetting whether you\u0026rsquo;ve rung 11 or 13 courses. But in general, a composition with 2 to 6 parts will save you on memorization (as long as the parts themselves aren\u0026rsquo;t too difficult).\nThere are also other types of structures to be aware of. For example, bobs often come in sets of three. This fact is due to the underlying mathematics of composition, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about the why so much; this pattern is pervasive in many compositions and you\u0026rsquo;ll start seeing it everywhere now that you know! In the composition above, notice that in each part there is a bob at Home and once you\u0026rsquo;ve hit three bobs at Home, you need a single at Home. This is not a coincidence.\nSimilarly, singles often come in sets of two. The 720 of Plain Bob Minor a few paragraphs above shows this nicely; there is a single at the middle and a single at the end. This, too, is no accident and is due to the mathematics of composition but can be tucked away as a handy neat fact. Maybe someday it will come to your mind as you\u0026rsquo;re contemplating whether the next lead is a bob or a single!\nTip 2: Turn it into words (or a picture, or a song, or\u0026hellip;) #  Many people find they have a preferred way or ways that they memorize information, whether they\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it or not. Do you have to make up a silly song to remember phone numbers? Do you simply visualize a map in your head when recalling how to get from Point A to Point B? Do you prefer when the teacher writes everything on the board, or do you like it more when lectures are given purely verbally?\nTake a minute to reflect on how you learn best and how to transform that into a successful strategy for learning compositions. I can give you an example for how I learn compositions (this is, incidentally, also the way I learn complex new methods; so the skills are transferable!). I like to turn the composition into a set of words that I can then easily memorize. For example, for the 720 above, I would remember it as \u0026ldquo;Wrong Home Wrong three times, single at middle and end\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s only 10 words long, they\u0026rsquo;re all pretty short words, and I can have it memorized fairly quickly. I can repeat it to myself while I conduct, as well.\nVery visual learners may find it easier to simply take a mental snapshot of the composition as it appears on the page. Others use different strategies; there are probably about as many strategies as ringers. So, thinking about the ways in which you memorize other information and figuring out how to apply that to compositions will be well worth the time.\nTip 3: Repeat, repeat, repeat #  Finally, the best advice I have is also the least exciting. The best way to get better is just to practice and repeat. If you can\u0026rsquo;t reliably repeat the composition (in some form), have a friend help you out. Repeat it to yourself (or visualize it, or whatever) as you bike to work, brush your teeth, or chop vegetables. I hear some ringers even keep laminated sheets in their shower to avail themselves of some steamy revision time! The more you study and practice, the more you will get out of it.\nExercises #  Find this #  A key component to learning and memorizing long, complex compositions (or methods, or anything really) is your ability to find and exploit patterns to make your life as easy as possible. With that aim in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s practice a few types of pattern-finding you might find useful. For all the questions below, assume we\u0026rsquo;re talking about Plain Bob Minor.\nfunction checkAnswer(id, answer) { answerLabel = document.getElementById('label'+id); rawinp = document.getElementById(id).value; var inp = rawinp.trim(); console.log(inp) if (inp === answer) { answerLabel.innerText = \"That's right!\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"blue\"; } else if (inp === \"\") { answerLabel.innerText = \"Please type in the box and then submit.\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"black\"; } else { answerLabel.innerText = \"Not quite right...\"; answerLabel.style.color = \"red\"; } }   Exercise  Consider the touch ppppbppppbppppb. What is the smallest unit that you can repeat in order to get the whole touch? Write it out with p\u0026#39;s and b\u0026#39;s.
