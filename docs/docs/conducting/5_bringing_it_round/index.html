  Bringing It Round
  <a class="anchor" href="#bringing-it-round">#</a>
</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through a lot of material together! This last section is just for compositions to get you good practice at &ldquo;bringing it round,&rdquo; so to speak.</p>
<h2 id="composition-collections">
  Composition collections
  <a class="anchor" href="#composition-collections">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The skills and techniques you&rsquo;ve learned can be applied to nearly any composition, including those from the chapter on Calling. However, it&rsquo;s sometimes useful to have access to a small list of compositions to choose from which are uniquely suited to one&rsquo;s needs. With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve compiled a few compositions for you. There are two CompLib collections which I think you might enjoy:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://complib.org/collection/11083"><em>Calling It Round: Good quarters for practice</em></a> is a collection that has 13 quarter compositions for Major methods.</li>
<li><a href="https://complib.org/collection/10904"><em>Mix and Match: Simple Quarter Peals of Minor</em></a> is a collection that does what it says on the tin! It has several 720s (extents of minor) and a few bits less than that to add up to make a quarter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these collections tend towards simple, commonly-rung quarter peals. Many have a very limited set of calling positions, and where possible only 3- or 4-bell coursing orders to keep track of.</p>
<h2 id="other-resources">
  Other resources
  <a class="anchor" href="#other-resources">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you are interested in finding other compositions with which to practice, I can recommend the following online resources:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="complib.org">Composition Library</a>, run by Graham John, has an extensive collection and a good search engine.</li>
<li><a href="ringing.org">ringing.org</a>, run by Don Morrison, also has an extensive (though perhaps slightly more curated) collection all very well-organized under different headings and easy to browse through.</li>
</ol>
<p>I almost always check both places when looking for a composition.</p>
<p>As far as print resources, there are many good ones.</p>
<ol>
<li>A favorite of mine is <em>The Ringing World Diary</em>, published each year by <em>The Ringing World</em> with a very carefully curated selection of good touches, quarter peals, and peals. It can be purchased <a href="https://www.ringingworld.co.uk/purchase/shop/diary.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>There are also a variety of compilations by John Longridge, such as <em>Composition 500</em> (for peals), <em>Quarter 500</em> (for quarters), and <em>Standard 90</em>, which contains touches, quarter peals, and peals alike. John Longridge&rsquo;s books can be purchased through <a href="https://jnlrb.wordpress.com/">the support website for his books</a>.</li>
<li>There are also many collections available through the <a href="https://www.whitingsociety.org.uk/publications/publications.html">Whiting Society</a> but I have not personally read any of the books in this collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>The print resources, especially the older ones, may follow slightly different conventions than I have in <em>Calling It Round</em>; but variety is the spice of life and now it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out what you like best! There are also many other wonderful sources of compositions both on the internet and in print.</p>
