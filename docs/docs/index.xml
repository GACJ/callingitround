      <description>Final Words #  I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that there is a lot more content about calling and conducting than I could possibly write for Calling It Round. One of the biggest joys of ringing, for me, is the possibility of constant growth and learning; and there&amp;rsquo;s so much more to learn about conducting than the meagre amount I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to set down here. My hope is that this site was helpful in giving you grounding in some basics, giving you context for some common conventions, and giving you a reason to go practice!</description>
