One of the biggest joys of ringing, for me, is the possibility of constant growth and learning; and there&amp;rsquo;s so much more to learn about conducting than the meagre amount I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to set down here. My hope is that this site was helpful in giving you grounding in some basics, giving you context for some common conventions, and giving you a reason to go practice!</description></item></channel></rss>
